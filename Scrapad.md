The origins of the phrase “Survival of the fittest” is still very relevant in today’s society. Looking at the environment around us, it still very much mirrors England during the Industrial Revolution. It seems only the strongest individuals get to be successful in an industrialised country.

The question is, how does industrialisation disrupt the sense of community in a nation’s culture?
