Terms for describing circuits

| Term             | Definition                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node             | A point where two or more circuit elements join                                     |
| Essential node   | A node where three or more circuit elements join                                    |
| Path             | A trace of adjoining basic elements with no elements included more than once        |
| Branch           | A path that connects two nodes                                                      |
| Essential Branch | A path which connects two essential nodes without passing through an essential node |
| Loop             | A path whose last node is the same as the starting node                             |
| Mesh             | A loop that does not enclose any other loops                                        |
| Planar circuit   | A circuit that can be drawn on a plane with no crossing branches                    |

Two nodes connected only by a wire with no additional circuit components are considered only one node
