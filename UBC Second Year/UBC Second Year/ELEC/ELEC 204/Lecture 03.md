Wheatstone Bridge
	accurate device for measuring resistance
	Centre leg of the circuit contains a galvanometer ( a very sensitive device used to measure current)
	When the unknown resistor is connected to the bridge, $R_3$ is adjusted until the current in the galvanometer, at which the bridge is balanced
