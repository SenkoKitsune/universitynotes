Wheatstone Bridge
	accurate device for measuring resistance
	Centre leg of the circuit contains a galvanometer ( a very sensitive device used to measure current)
	When the unknown resistor is connected to the bridge, $R_3$ is adjusted until the current in the galvanometer, at which the bridge is balanced

Wye-Delta
	Y & Δ networks are said to be balanced when $R_1=R_2=R_3=R_Y$ & $R_A=R_B=R_C=R_Δ$
	$\displaystyle R_1 = \frac{R_BR_C}{R_A+R_B+R_C}$
	$\displaystyle R_2 = \frac{R_AR_C}{R_A+R_B+R_C}$
	$\displaystyle R_3 = \frac{R_AR_C}{R_A+R_B+R_C}$
