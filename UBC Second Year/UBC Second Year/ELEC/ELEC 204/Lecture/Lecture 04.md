Loop and Mesh analysis

Mesh analysis is a special case of a more general technique called loop analysis
A mesh is a loop that does not contain any other loops within it
Mesh analysis is not quite as general as nodal analysis since it can only be applied to planar circuits
A planar circuit is a circuit that can be drawn in a plane with no branches crossing one another

Number of linearly independent loops
	IN a circuit with B branches and N nodes there are N-N+1 linearly independent loops
	Number of independent loops is equal to the number of meshes
