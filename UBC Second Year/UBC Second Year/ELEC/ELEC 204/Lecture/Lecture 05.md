Source transformation
Source transformation refers to the process of replacing a voltage source in series with a resistor R with a current source in parallel with a resistor and vice verse

In many circuits source transformation can simplify the analysis
Recall that a pair of two terminal networks (circuits) are equivalent if they have the same terminal V-I characteristics
