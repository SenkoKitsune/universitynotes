A set is a collection of objects
	Only one question: *Is an object an element of the set or not*
	
The order in which the elements of a set are listed does not matter. Repetitions are ignored.
	$\set{1,2,3}, \set{3,2,1}$ and $\set{1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3}$ are all the same set

The notation $x \in A$ means that $x$ is an element of the set $A$
The notation $x \notin A$ means that $x$ is not an element of the set $A$

Often, the elements of a set are numbers, but they can be anything:
	numbers, letters, words, functions, people, and even other sets

There are two main ways of writing sets:
	listing the elements and set-builder notation

Listing the elements:
	$A = \set{1,2,3}$

Set-builder notation is a way to describe a set by giving a **rule** that determines which elements are in the set
	$B = \set{x \in \mathbb{Z} \mid x^2 = 4}$
Another way to write the same set:
	$B = \set{x \in \mathbb{Z} : x^2 = 4}$

A very important set is the empty set, denoted by $\emptyset$ or $\set{}$

Two sets that in builder notation may look quite different may actually be the same set
$\set{x\in\mathbb{R} \mid x^2 = -1}$ $\set{y\in\mathbb{Z} : y+2 = y+1}$ are both empty sets

$\emptyset \in \set{\emptyset}$ is not empty

Some sets have a finite number of elements, while others have infinite elements

We can write infinite sets by listing the first few elements, and then using "$...$" to indicate that the list continues forever
	$\set{1,4,9,16,25,...}$ is the set of all natural square numbers

It has to be clear what the pattern is, better to use set-builder notation
$\set{1,4,9,16,25,...} = \set{n^2 \mid n \in \mathbb{N}}$

We can use interval notation to describe sets of real numbers.
	$(0,1)$ is the set of all real numbers between 0 and 1, exclusive

Notations:
$\mathbb{N}$ = natural numbers $\set{1,2,3,4,...}$
$\mathbb{Z}$ = integers $\set{...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}$
$\mathbb{Q}$ = rational numbers
$\mathbb{R}$ = real numbers
$\mathbb{I}$ = irrational numbers
