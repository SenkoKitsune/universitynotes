Proofs:
	A mathematical proof is a logically sound explanation demonstrating that some mathematical statement is necessarily true
	If we want to show that a statement of the from $P \implies Q$ is true, we assume that $P$ is true and deduce that $Q$ is true
	A common way to establish that a statement $Q$ is true to consider a statement $P$ that we already know to be true, and prove $P \implies Q$
	We can do this through several intermediate steps of the form $P \implies R_1 \implies R_2 \implies ... \implies Q$
	Before starting a proof, it is important to make sure that we have clear definitions of all terms involved
