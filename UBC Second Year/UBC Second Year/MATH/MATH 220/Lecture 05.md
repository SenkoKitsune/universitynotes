Given integers $k$ and $n$, we say that k divides n (written as $k \div n$ )

If your proof also proves something that is false, then it is a false proof

Contrapositive and converse
	The converse of $P \implies Q$ is $Q \implies P$
	The contrapositive of $P\implies Q$ is $(\sim Q)\implies (\sim P$)$
	Lemma
		The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement
