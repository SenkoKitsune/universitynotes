A statement is an assertion that is either true or false (even if we don't know if it is true or false)

An open sentence is an assertion that involves one or more variables, and can be true or false depending on the value of the variables

If an assertion involving variables is always true or always false, irrespective of the values of the variables, then it is a statement, and not an open sentence

Logic notation
Given a statement P, we denote $\sim P$ the negation of P

Given 2 statements, P and Q, we denote $P \land Q$, the conjunction of P and Q (Logical And Statement)

Given 2 statements, P and Q, we denote by $P \lor Q$, the disjunction of P and Q (Logical Or Statement), either or both true $\to$ true

Given 2 statements, P and Q, we denote by $P \implies Q$, the implication of P and Q (If P then Q, P implies Q)
	The implication is false only if P is true and Q is false
	$P \implies Q$ is always true if P is false. 
		The reason is that one can deduce anything (true or false) starting from a false premise.
