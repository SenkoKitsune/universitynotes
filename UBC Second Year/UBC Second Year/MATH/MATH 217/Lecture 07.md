Partial Differential Equations
	Equation for a (unknown) function $u(x,y)$ involving partial derivatives of $u$

Laplace's equation
$u_{xx}+u_{yy} = 0$
	Solution to this equation are called harmonic functions
	The graphs of those are give by "soap bubbles"
		Given a wire frame dipped into a soap solution, the bubble will minimise area and be the graph of a harmonic function

Wave equation $u(x,t)$
	$u_{xx}-u_{tt} = 0$
	$u(x,t)$ displacement at position x and time t

Heat equation
	$u(x,t)$ = temperature of a 1-dimesnion object at position x and time t
	$u_{xx}-u_t = 0$

Schr√∂dinger's Equation
	$u_{xx}-iu_t = 0$

As in single variable calculus, we have implicit differentiation
	$z = \sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$
	$z$ = dependent variable
	$x,y$ are independent variables
	$\displaystyle \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}}$

Sometimes we are given a relation:
	$x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1$
	Use this equation to implicitly define $z$ as a function of $x$ and $y$
	$z = z(x,y)$
