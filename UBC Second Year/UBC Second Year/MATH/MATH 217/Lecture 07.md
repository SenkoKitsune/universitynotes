Partial Differential Equations
	Equation for a (unknown) function $u(x,y)$ involving partial derivatives of $u$

$u_{xx}+u{yy} = 0$
Laplace's equation
	Solution to this equation are called harmonic functions
	The graphs of those are give by "soap bubbles"
		Given a wire frame dipped into a soap solution, the bubble will minimise area
