Differential calculus is about rate of change
Integral calculus is about accumulation
	adding up an "infinite number" of "infinitesimally things"

Multivariable calculus
	derivatives and integrals of real-valued functions with multiple variables
		$f(x,y), f(x,y,z)$
		
Vector calculus
	differential and integral calculus of vector-valued functions with one or more variables

Vector is a quantity with magnitude and direction
	represented by an arrow

We can think of a vector-valued function $\vec{F}(t)$ as describing the position of a moving object at time $t$

Vector-valued functions of multiple values
	Vector fields:
		$\vec{F}(x,y)$
			to each point in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we get an arrow
