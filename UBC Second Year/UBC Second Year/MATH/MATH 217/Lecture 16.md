Vector calculus: calculus of vector valued functions

Vector valued function of several variables is known as vector fields
	$\vec{F}(x,y) = < P(x,y), Q(x,y) >$
	$= P(x,y)\vec{i} + Q(x,y)\vec{j}$

An example we have seen is the gradient vector field
	(if $f(x,y)$ is a scalar function, we get $\vec{\nabla}f = <f_x, f_y>$ is a vector field)
	A vector field $\vec{F}$ which is the gradient of $f$ is called conservative
		$\vec{F} = \vec{\nabla} f$
	$f(x,y)$ is called a potential function

Not every vector field is conservative

We also have vector fields in $\mathbb{R}^3$
	$\vec{F}(x,y,z) = <P(x,y,z),Q(x,y,z), R(x,y,z)>$
		$= P(x,y,z)\vec{i} + Q(x,y,z)\vec{j} + R(x,y,z)\vec{k}$
		Hard to draw, we often just draw the values at a surface

We will use the notation
	$\vec{r}(x,y) = <x,y>$
	$\vec{r}(x,y,z) = <x,y,z>$
