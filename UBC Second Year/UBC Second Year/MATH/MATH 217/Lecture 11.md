A function on a closed interval $[a.b]$ achieves it's min/max at a critical point or at the boundaries

Classifying critical points of $f(x,y)$
	$(x_0,y_0)$ is a critical point of $f$ if $(\vec{\nabla}f)(x_0,y_0) = 0$
		The tangent plane at $(x_0,y_0)$ is horizontal
	Ordinary critical points come in 3 types
		| Local Max | Local Min | Saddle point |
		| --------- | --------- | ------------ |
		|           |           |              |
