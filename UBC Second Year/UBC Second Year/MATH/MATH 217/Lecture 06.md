Functions of 2 and 3 variables
	A function of two variables with Domain
		$D \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is a rule $f$ which for every $(x,y) \in D$ gives $f(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}$

$f(x,y)$ is usually given by some algebraic expression (i.e. a formula)

When $f$ is given by a formula, there is often an implied domain, i.e., the set of $(x,y)$ for which the formula makes sense

Partial derivatives:

Consider a function $f(x,y)$, we can treat $x$ as a variable and $y$ as a constant and take the derivative with respect to $x$
	$\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x,y) = f_x(x,y)$
	Similarly
		$\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = f_y(x,y)$

If $z = f(x,y)$
	$\displaystyle \frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = f_x$
