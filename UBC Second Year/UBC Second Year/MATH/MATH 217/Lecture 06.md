Functions of 2 and 3 variables
	A function of two variables with Domain
		$D \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is a rule $f$ which for every $(x,y) \in D$ gives $f(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}$

$f(x,y)$ is usually given by some algebraic expression (i.e. a formula)

When $f$ is given by a formula, there is often an implied domain, i.e., the set of $(x,y)$ for which the formula makes sense
