Linear equations and the integrating factor
	A first oreder diffeential equation is linear if it can be put into the following form:
		$y' = p(x)y=f(x)$
	Look for an integrating factor $μ(x)$, so that if we multiply both sides of $y' + p(x)y = f(x)$ by $μ(x)&, then the left hand side becomes
		$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\left[ μ(x) y \right]$
	Multiply by $μ(x)$: $μ(x)y' + μ(x)p(x)y = f(x) μ(x)$
		We want left hand side to be
			$\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}\left[ μ(x)y\right] = μ(x)y' + μ'(x)y$
