Differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function y and at least one derivative of y

Differential equations are used to build models of reality

Ordinary Differential Equation s are differential equations with respect to noly on independent variable
	Logistic equation: $\displaystyle \frac{dP}{dt} = rP(1-\frac{P}{k})$
		models how (many) animal populations grow

Partial differential equations are differential equations with respect to many independent variables
	Heat equation : $\displaystyle \frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t} = D\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}$
		Models heat dispersal through rod
		Sea ice dispersed through ocean

The order of a differential equation is determined by the highest derivative that appears in the differential equation

An ordinary differential equation is called linear if it can be put into the following form:
	$\displaystyle a_n(x)\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}+a_{n-1}(x)\frac{d^{n-1}y}{dx^{n-1}}+ ... + a_1(x)\frac{dy}{dx}+a_0(x)y=b(x)$

In general we can solve many linear equations analytically and not that many non-linear equations 

An equation (or system) is called *autonomous* if the equation does not depend on the independent variable, otherwise it is called *non-autonomous*. A first order autonomous differential equation has the form:
	$\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$
