An equation or system is called autonomous if the equation does not depend on the independent variables, otherwise it is called non-autonomous
	A first order autonomous differential equation has the form
		$\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt}=f(x)$

Example
	The logistic equation
		$\displaystyle \frac{dP}{dt}=rP\left(1-\frac{P}{K} \right)$

For autonomous equations, the slope field is independent of $t$

For the autonomous equation $x\prime = f(x)$, $x_0$ is called a critical point (or fixed point or steady state or equilibrium) if $f(x_0) = 0$ Then $x(t) = x_0$ is a constant solution to the differential equation, also known as an equilibrium solution 

A phase line records $\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt}$ values on a horizontal (or vertical) x-axis for the differential equation $x\prime = f(x)$. To draw a phase line, identify the critical points and record the direction of movement in between. Whenever $f(x) > 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is increasing and we add a right-pointing arrow. Whenever $f(x) < 0$ the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing and we add a left-pointing arrow. Whenever $f(x) = 0$, we have an equilibrium

Another method to analyse an autonomous differential equation $x\prime = f(x)$ is to plot the function $f(x)$. Whenever $f(x) > 0$, the solution $x(t)$ is increasing and we add a right-pointing arrow. Whenever $f(x) < 0$ the solution $x(t)$ is decreasing and we add a left-pointing arrow. Whenever $f(x) = 0$, we have an equilibrium
