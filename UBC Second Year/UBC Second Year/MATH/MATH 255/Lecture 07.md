An equation or system is called autonomous if the equation does not depend on the independent variables, otherwise it is called non-autonomous
	A first order autonomous differential equation has the form
		$\displaystyle \frac{dx}{dt}=f(x)$

Example
	The logistic equation
		$\displaystyle \frac{dP}{dt}=rP\left(1-\frac{P}{K} \right)$

For autonomous equations, the slope field is independent of $t$
