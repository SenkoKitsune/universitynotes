Slope fields

For first order equations $y' = f(x,y)$ gives you a slope at each point in the $(x,y)$ plane. To plot a slope field, plot the slope $y' = f(x,y)$ at a given number of $(x,y)$ coordinates

1) Plot the slopes as vectors $<1, f(x,y)>$
2) Arrows always point right
3) Initial data gives a starting point
4) Can guess path of a solution by following the arrows
	$y(t)$ is always tangent to $y' = f(x,y)$
