Slope fields

For first order equations $y' = f(x,y)$ gives you a slope at each point in the $(x,y)$ plane. To plot a slope field, plot the slope $y' = f(x,y)$ at a given number of $(x,y)$ coordinates

1) Plot the slopes as vectors $<1, f(x,y)>$
2) Arrows always point right
3) Initial data gives a starting point
4) Can guess path of a solution by following the arrows
	$y(t)$ is always tangent to $y' = f(x,y)$

Picard's theorem on existence and uniqueness: If $f(x,y)$ is continuous (as a function of two variables) and $\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ exists and is continuous near some $(x_0, y_0)$, then a solution to $y' = f(x,y), y(x_0) = y+0$ exists (at least for $x$ on some small interval and is unique)
	There exists a $f > 0$ such that the solution exists for $(x_0 - \partial f, x_0 + \partial f)$
		*Our solution doesn't need to exist for all x*
