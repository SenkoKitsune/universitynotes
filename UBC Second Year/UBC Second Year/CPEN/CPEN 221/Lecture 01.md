Good software should be
1) Correct
2) Comprehensible
3) Changeable

Static analysis
	What d we know about the program before we run it
	Is it correct
	A compiler checks for some static analysis
		Compiler may not be correct

Dynamic checking:
	Verification of correctness at runtime
	Java supports dynamic verification because programs run on the Java Virtual Machine
