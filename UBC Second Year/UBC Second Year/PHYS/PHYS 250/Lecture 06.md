Wave equation: $\dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2} = \dfrac{1}{v^2}\dfrac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}$ for $y(x,t)$
	Second order in both time and space
	Solution: $y(x,t) = f(x \pm vt)$ for any $f(\text{one argument})$
		If solution is a sinusoid with wavelength $\lambda$ and period $T$
			$y(x,t) = A\sin\left[  2\pi\left(\pm\dfrac{x}{\lambda}-\dfrac{t}{T}\right) + \phi \right]$ with $v = \dfrac{\lambda}{T}$
		It's convenient to write the sinusoid solutions as
			$y(x,t) = A\sin[\pm k = \omega t + \phi]$ with $k = \dfrac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ and $\omega = \dfrac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f$
				Putting the minus sign on $\omega t$ makes the wave direction have the same sign as $k$
				To satisfy the wave equation we still require $v = \dfrac{\lambda}{T} = \dfrac{2\pi/k}{2\pi / \omega} = \dfrac{\omega}{k}$
$p = \hslash k$
$E = \hslash\omega$
