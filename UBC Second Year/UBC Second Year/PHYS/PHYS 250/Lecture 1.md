$T_{//} = \dfrac{L}{c+u} + \dfrac{L}{c-u} = \dfrac{2L}{c}\dfrac{1}{1-\dfrac{u^2}{c^2}}$
So the effects get a $10^{-8}$ effect from 30km/s

To get the time in cycles
$cycles_{//} = \dfrac{c}{\lambda}\dfrac{2L}{c}\dfrac{1}{1-\dfrac{u^2}{c^2}} \approx \dfrac{2L}{\lambda}\left(1+\dfrac{u^2}{c^2}\right)$
There is also an effect on the other arm
$L'^2 = L^2 + \left(\dfrac{uT_{\perp}}{2}\right)^2$
	$T = \dfrac{2L'}{c}$

$cycles_{\perp} = T_{\perp}\cdot f \approx \dfrac{2L}{\lambda}\left(1+\dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{u^2}{c^2}\right)$
The perpendicular arm extra delay has the same sign and is half as much, so the net effect is cut in half
	fringe shift = $cycles_{\parallel}-cycles_{\perp} \approx \dfrac{L}{\lambda}{u^2}{c^2}$
	
The Earth moves $2\pi \cdot 150\times10^6$ km around the Sun in $265.25\cdot 24\cdot 60\cdot 60 = 3.16\times 10^7$ sec, so $u = 29.86$ km/s
The Sun also orbits around the entre of mass of galaxy. This is estimated about 200km/s. 6.7 times faster than Earth vs Sun
Cosmic microwave background radiation looks a bit colder in one direction (more red-shift) than the opposite direction/ This implies our galaxy is moving about 630 km/s, 21 times faster than Earth vs Sun

A red-shift of 1.1 means the source is moving away at 10% the speed of light

Coordinate system Jargon
$S$ is a frame with origin $O$ for coordinate $x$ and time $t$
$S'$ is another frame with origin $O'$ for coordinate $x'$ and time $t'$
$S'$ is moving with veloticy $u$ in the x-direction as seen from S

For arithemetical convenience, we assume that the origins of $O$ and $O'$ overlap at
