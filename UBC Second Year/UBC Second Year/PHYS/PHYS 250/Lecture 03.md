Electromagnetic waves can only have certain discrete (quantized) amplitudes
	Photons have energy $E=hf$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is the frequency
	Momentum, satisfying $E = pc$, so $p = \dfrac{E}{f} = \dfrac{hf}{c}$
	Photon scattering from charged particles changes the momentum of both

The probability for a small sub-system to have energy E is proportional to $e^{\dfrac{E}{kT}}$

In a conducting metal box, there can be oscillating electromagnetic fields
	There are boundary conditions: electric field parallel to a metal surface must be zero, magnetic field normal to a metal surface must be zero
If the box is rectangular, the allowed frequencies are 
	$f = \dfrac{c}{2}\sqrt{\dfrac{n_x^2}{a_x^2}+\dfrac{n_y^2}{a_y^2} + \dfrac{n_z^2}{a_z^2}}$
	where $a_x, a_y, a_z$ are the dimensions of the box, and $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are the number of half-cycles across each dimension, integers 1,2,3, etc.

Rayleigh-Jeans predication
	The EM modes form a grid in $n_x, n_y$, and $n_z$ space, up to infinite $n$ values
	The number of allowed frequencies less than $f$ is proportional to $f^3$, so the number near $f$ is proportional to $f^2df$
		$dI_{RJ}(f) = \dfrac{2f^2}{c^2}kTdf$
		This is the power flow in $\dfrac{J}{s\cdot m^2}$ that would come out of a small hole cut in a metal box at temperature $T$
	Using $f = \dfrac{c}{\lambda}$ so $df = \dfrac{c}{\lambda^2}d\lambda$ and $
	$dI_{RJ}(\lambda) = \dfrac{2c}{\lambda^4}kTd\lambda$
