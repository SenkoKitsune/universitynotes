$\beta = -$ corresponds to rest, increasing $\beta$ means faster
	$\beta \pm 1$ is the speed of light. It will turn out that $|u| \leq c$ so $|\beta| \leq 1$

$\gamma = 1$ corresponds to rest, increasing $\gamma$ means faster
	$\gamma$ is never less than 1. As $\beta$ approaches $\pm 1$, $\gamma$ goes to infinity

For small $\beta$, Taylor-expanding gives $\gamma \approx 1+\dfrac{1}{2}\beta^2$
Inverting, $\gamma^2 = \dfrac{1}{1-\beta^2} \to 1-\beta^2 = \dfrac{1}{\gamma^2} \to \beta = \sqrt{1-\dfrac{1}{\gamma^2}}$
Taylor expanding for large $\gamma$ gives $\beta \approx 1 - \dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{1}{\gamma^2}$

Classical Doppler Effect
	For observer at rest and source moving away at velocity $u$,
		$\Delta T_{obs} = \Delta T_{source} + \dfrac{u\Delta T_{source}}{c} = \Delta T_{source}\left(1+\dfrac{u}{c}\right)$
		Since frequency $f=\dfrac{1}{\Delta T}$, $f_{obs} = \dfrac{f_{source}}{1+\dfrac{u}{c}}$
		Since wavelength $\lambda = c\Delta T, \lambda_{obs} = \lambda_{source}\left(1+\dfrac{u}{c}\right)$
	For source at rest, and observer moving away,
		$\Delta T_{obs} = \Delta T_{source} + \dfrac{u\Delta T_{source}}{c} = \Delta T_{source}\left(1-\dfrac{u}{c}\right)$
		$f_{obs} = \dfrac{f_{source}}{1-\dfrac{u}{c}}$

Extreme Classical Doppler Effect
	For an observer at rest, $f_{obs} = \dfrac{f_{source}}
