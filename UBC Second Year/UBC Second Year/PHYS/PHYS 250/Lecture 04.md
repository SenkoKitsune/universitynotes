Measuring light waves
	If the light goes through small slits, it emerges in circular waves
	In the forward direction, they are all in phase
	But they are also in phase for some other directions
	If the spacing is $d$, the path-length difference between slits in $\Delta x = d\sin\theta$

$d\sin\theta = n\lambda$
	If $d >> \lambda$, $\theta$ would be very small and diffraction is invisible
	If $\lambda > d$, $\sin\theta > 1$ and diffraction would be impossible
	$n = 0$, light goes right through

Absorption bands
	Atomic emission and absorption are due to vibration of electrons
		Electrons have low mass, so $\omega = \sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}}$ frequency is high
		Atoms form molecules, and have higher mass so the frequencies are lower
		Molecules can rotate
			Gives absorption lines so close together they look continuous and they are called absorption bands
