Pauli exclusion principle
	The wavefunction for identical particles 1 and 2 is $\Psi(\vec{x}_1,s_1,\vec{x}_2s_2)$ and $1 \leftrightarrow 2$ must do nothing, or flip the sign of the function
	The relativistic Dirac Equation predicts electrons come in 2 spin states
	Quantum filed theory says for such particles, the sign must flip
	If the particles have $\vec{x}$ dependence (different orbits) or different $s$-values (different spins), everything is fine
		But if they have the same $\vec{x}$ dependence and the same $s$-values, then flipping the sign does nothing, but it's supposed to flip the sign. 
			That means $\Psi = 0$

For most elements, the binding energy is about 8MeV per proton or neutron
