Taking measurements:
	Two sources of uncertainty
		Instrument uncertainty $\sigma_I$
		Measurement uncertainty $\sigma_M$
	Total uncertainty usually is $\sigma_T=\sqrt{\sigma^2_M+\sigma^2_I}$
	In this lab normally either $\sigma_M$ dominates, which makes $\sigma_M = \sigma_T$

Instrument uncertainty
	For the DMM the instrument uncertainty is spec'd as 0.5% +2(last) digits
	For the AD2, the least significant bit is uncertain
