$dS = \dfrac{1}{T}dU + \dfrac{P}{T}ddV - \dfrac{\mu}{T}dN \leftrightarrow dU = TdS - PdV + \mu dN$

Entropy drivers
	Large $\dfrac{-\mu}{T}$: System is very eager to pull in more particles in order to maximize its entropy

$\mu$ is how much the internal energy would have to change to add a particle while keeping $S$ fixed

$H = U + PV$ is a state variable called enthalpy
	$U$ is the energy required to make a system out of nothign
	$PV$ is the energy required to push away an environment at the system's pressure, to make space for the system with volume $V$
	So $H$ is the energy to make a system, and push away an environment at the same pressure to make space for it

$dH = TdS = PdV + \mu dN + pdV + VdP$
$dH = TdS + VdP + \mu dN$
	$dH = TdS$ when $P,N$ are constants
	just like $dU = TdS$ when $V,N$ are constants
	So $H$ maps to heat flow in a constant pressure process
