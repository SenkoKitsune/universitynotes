Quantization in quantum mechanics
	Quantum mechanically, the radius and energies of orbits are quantized (discrete)
	At the most rudimentary level, because electrons are waves
	There is a phase-matching condition for electron orbits, just like for standing waves on a string/in a tube
	Phase-matching in an orbit is equivalent to boundary conditions in the standing-wave problem in acoustics
	The wave nature of electrons is encapsulated in it's wavefunction, often called $\psi$ or $\phi$
	$\psi$ assigns an amplitude and a phase to every possible characteristic of the particle
	The amplitude of $\psi$ is related to how likely it is to find the particle with that characteristic ($|\psi|^2$ is the probability density of the characteristic)
	There is a "wave equation" that governs EM waves: $\nabla^2\vec{E}\propto \dfrac{d^2\vec{E}}{dt^2}$, and nearly identical one that governs string/acoustics
	The wave equation that governs $\psi$ is the Schr√∂dinger Equation
		$\hat{H}\psi = i\hslash \dfrac{d\psi}{dt}$
		Where $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian and in the simplest case $\hat{H} = \nabla^2$
