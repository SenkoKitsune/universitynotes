Efficiency: $\epsilon = \dfrac{\text{The output you are interested in}}{\text{The input you have to "spend" to get it}}$ 
Electric Motors: $\epsilon = \dfrac{\text{Work Out}}{\text{Electric Energy In}}$
Heat Engines: $\epsilon = \dfrac{\text{Net work out}}{\text{Heat In}}$
Refrigerators: $\epsilon = \dfrac{\text{Heat moved from cold to hot}}{\text{Work (Electric or Mechanical) In}}$

Work $\displaystyle W_{in} = -\int_{\text{initial}}^{\text{final}}PdV, W_{out} = \int_{\text{initial}}^{\text{final}}PdV$

Remember net work = net heat

Heat $\displaystyle Q_{in} = \int_{\text{intial}}^{\text{final}}TdS$ (assume quasistatic)
Heat engine efficiency is just the ratio of the area inside the cycle over the integral under the top part of the graph
