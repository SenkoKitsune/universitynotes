State variables
Intensive vs extensive
	$P, V, T, N, U, S, \mu$
		$P$ - pressure
		$V$ - volume
		$T$ - temperature
		$N$ - number of particles in the system
		$U$ - internal energy
		$S$ - Entropy
		$\mu$ - Chemical potential
	Much of thermodynamics is encapsulated in finding relations between these variables
