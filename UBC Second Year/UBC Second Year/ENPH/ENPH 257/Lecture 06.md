Systems A and B will exchange energy $dU_A$ until $S_{total}$ is maximized
	$\dfrac{\partial S_{total}}{\partial U_A} = 0$ at max of $S_{total}$
	$\dfrac{\partial S_{total}}{\partial U_A} = 0 \implies \dfrac{\partial S_{total}}{\partial U_A} = \dfrac{\partial S_B}{\partial U_B}$
	Systems A and B will exchange energy until $\dfrac{\partial S_{total}}{\partial U_A} = \dfrac{\partial S_B}{\partial U_B}$, which implies thermal equilibrium $T_A = T_B$
	For historical reasons we set $\dfrac{\partial S_A}{\partial U_A} = \dfrac{1}{T_A}$
		$\left(\dfrac{\partial U_A}{\partial S_A}\right)_{N,V} = T_A$

$\left(\dfrac{\partial U_A}{\partial S_A}\right)_{N,V} = T_A \to T\partial S$ when $N,V$ are constant
	but $\partial U = \delta Q + \delta W \implies \delta Q = (\partial U = T\partial S)_{N,V}$
	Constant volume heat capacity is how much heat must be put in to raise the temperature by a certain amount with no volume change $C_V \left(\dfrac{\delta Q}{dt}\right)_{\delta W = 0}$ 
		$C_V = \left(\dfrac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_{N, V}$
		$\delta Q = TdS$
		$dS = \dfrac{\delta Q}{T} = \dfrac{C_V dT}{T}$
