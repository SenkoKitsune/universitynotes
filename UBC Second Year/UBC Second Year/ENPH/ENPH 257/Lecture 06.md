Systems A and B will exchange energy $dU_A$ until $S_{total}$ is maximized
	$\dfrac{\partial S_{total}}{\partial U_A} = 0$ at max of $S_{total}$
	$\dfrac{\partial S_{total}}{\partial U_A} = 0 \implies \dfrac{\partial S_{total}}{\partial U_A} = \dfrac{\partial S_B}{\partial U_B}$
	Systems A and B will exchange energy until $\dfrac{\partial S_{total}}{\partial U_A} = \dfrac{\partial S_B}{\partial U_B}$, which implies thermal equilibrium $T_A = T_B$
