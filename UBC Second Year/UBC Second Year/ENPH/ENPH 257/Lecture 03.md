Microstate: the precise description of a state including specification of the value for each degree of freedom

Macrostate: a set of states corresponding to some macroscopic characteristic, or set of characteristics

Multiplicity of a macrostate: $\Omega$: How many microstates there are corresponding to the macroscopic characteristic that defines the microstate

In real crystals, vibrations spread (phonons) but in real Einstein solids each atom is in its own isolated cell
	Einstein solids are a good approximation for crystals at high temperature
		(room T)

Classically, energy of each oscillator is continuous:
	$E = \dfrac{1}{2}kx^2 + \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2$
Quantum mechanically, energy of each oscillator is quantized, just like 1s, 2s, 2p energy levels of hydrogen atom:
	$E = (n+\dfrac{1}{2})\hslash\omega$  for $n \in 0,1,2,...$
You can think of each oscillator (every atom has $x,y,z$ oscillators) as able to hold $0,1,2,3...$ energy units of size $\hslash\omega$
