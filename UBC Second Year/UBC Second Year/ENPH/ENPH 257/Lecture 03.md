Microstate: the precise description of a state including specification of the value for each degree of freedom

Macrostate: a set of states corresponding to some macroscopic characteristic, or set of characteristics

Multiplicity of a macrostate: $\Omega$: How many microstates there are corresponding to the macroscopic characteristic that defines the microstate

In real crystals, vibrations spread (phonons) but in real Einstein solids each atom is in its own isolated cell
	Einstein solids are a good approximation for crystals at high temperature
		(room T)

Classically, energy of each oscillator is continuous:
	$E = \dfrac{1}{2}kx^2 + \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2$
Quantum mechanically, energy of each oscillator is quantized, just like 1s, 2s, 2p energy levels of hydrogen atom:
	$E = (n+\dfrac{1}{2})\hslash\omega$  for $n \in 0,1,2,...$
You can think of each oscillator (every atom has $x,y,z$ oscillators) as able to hold $0,1,2,3...$ energy units of size $\hslash\omega$

Multiplicity of joint systems
	If there are X possible configurations of system A, and Y configurations of system B, there are $X\cdot Y$ configurations of the joint system $A + B$
	Interacting systems A and B have a joint multiplicity $\Omega_{joint}$ that is the product of $\Omega$ of the individual systems $\Omega_{joint} = \Omega_A \times \Omega_B$
	For interacting Einstein solids, with energy $E_A$ in A and $E_B$ in B, that multiplicity depends on how the total energy $E = E_A + E_B$ is shared between the systems:
		$\Omega_{joint,E}(E_A)$
	Where $\Omega_{N,q}$ is the multiplicity for an ES with N oscillators and q units of energy
	For large systems, $\Omega_{joint, E}(E_A)$ is typically a Gaussian peaked at the most likely energy to be found in A
	When systems are small, $\Omega_{joint, E}(E_A)$ may not be Gaussian, and in that case the most likely energy is not necessarily the average energy
