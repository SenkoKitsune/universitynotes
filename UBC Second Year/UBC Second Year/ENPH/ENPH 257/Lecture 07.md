Probabilistically, systems tend to acquire more energy when they can
	How much they try to acquire extra energy maps to $1/T$
		$\dfrac{\partial S}{\partial U} = \dfrac{1}{T}$

Probabilistically, systems try to expand to larger volume
	How much they try to expand maps to $P/T$
		$\dfrac{\partial S}{\partial V} = \dfrac{P}{T}$

Pressure equilibrium $(P_A = P_B)$ means two systems fight equally for extra volume
	This mapping is less obvious because it is hard for two systems to exchange volume without exchanging energy

Also, mathematically we have $df(x,y,z,\dots) = \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial x}dx + \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial y}dy + \dfrac{\partial f}{\partial z}dz + \dots$
	So $dS(U,V) = \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial U}dU + \dfrac{\partial S}{\partial V}dV$
	$dS(U,V,N) = \dfrac{1}{T}dU + \dfrac{P}{T}dV \longrightarrow TdS = dU + PdV \longrightarrow dU = TdS = PdV$
		This expression is always true under the assumption that the number of particles do not change

$dU = TdS = PdV$ and $dU = \delta Q + \delta Q$
	is $\delta Q = TdS$ and $\delta W = -PdV$
	$\delta Q = dU - \delta W$ and $dU + PdV = TdS$
	$\delta Q = dU - \delta W$ = $dU + PdV = TdS$
		if $\delta W =
