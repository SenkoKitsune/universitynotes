Memory and forgetting

1) Exposed to information
2) Short-term (working memory)
	1) Maintenance: revisiting the information
3) Organising (encoding)
	Into long-term memory
4) retrieving from long term into short-term memory

If distracted, it will not transfer into memory

Most that make it into short term memory are forgotten

Unused information in long term memory fade away

Short-term memory is limited
	Short-term memory usually lasts 15-30 seconds
	story only 7 +- 2 items

Effective strategy:
	combine small ideas into one chunk of information
	find patterns and relationships
	smaller idea of meaningful structures

The forgetting curve
	steeply dropping exponential curve
	Impacts of forgetting
		cannot not forget
	Distributed practice
		review every now and then
			boosts long term memory retention
				continue process with increased benefits with diminishing effort

Study strategies
1) Emphasize organization, not maintenance
2) Connect new information to what  you already know
	1) Concept maps reveal connections
3) Pace your learning
	1) Multiple, short, intense study sessions
	2) Cramming:
		1) More likely to miss
		2) Overload short-term memory
		3) Less time to organize 
		4) weak long term memory
4) Use retrieval to reinforce memory
