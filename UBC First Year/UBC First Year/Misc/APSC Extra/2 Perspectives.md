Shifting your Perspective

Bloom's Taxonomy
"Levels of learning"

Lowest learning level: Remembering -> Recall, list, name
Understanding: comprehending the facts from the lower level -> Recognize, explain
Applying: apply facts, rules, and concepts to do something useful -> Compute, use, implement
Analysing: breaking down information into component parts and using the parts -> Determine, organise, compare
Evaluating: Judging, no single right answer; developing, applying, and defending a set of criteria -> Judge, critique, appraise
Creating: extend the understanding to relative fields -> Develop, design, formulate

Bloom's perspective: a student's success is not ability but hard work

Development stages
Perry's Scheme

Black and white:
	answers are right or wrong
	"The teacher teachers; students memorize"
Everything is grey
	All opinions are equally valid
	"Tell the teacher what they want to hear"
Solutions depend on context
	Some solutions are better (more defensible) than others
	"Learn to evaluate and support solutions"

study Strategies
1) Identify the learning level expected and study at that level (or higher)
	1) reading textbooks and notes, testing
		1) Only work for lower levels
2) Chose study activities that challenge you
	1) Effort doesn't mean just spending a lot of time
2) Shift to higher levels to add challenge and depth
	1) Teaching others the material
	2) Creating own problems for others to solve
	3) To learn, read. To know, write. To master, teach.
4) Use a concept map to construct meaning
