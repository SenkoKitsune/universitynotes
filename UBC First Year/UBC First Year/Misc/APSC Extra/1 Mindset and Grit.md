Famous people shared certain traits:
1) Early work was nothing special
2) Passion and extreme hard work : **grit**
3) recognized that ability isn't fixed and isn't an limitation: **growth mindset**

Growth mindset:
to accept that intelligence, ability, and personality can be developed with effort
neuroplasticity: grow and restructure itself even in adulthood
effort is necessary
obstacles are opportunities for learning

Fixed mindset:
born with certain traits and qualities and it cannot be changed

Mindset can be changed

Better odds with academeics with a growth mindset

Effort matters: we can get better in anything when we apply ourselves
Challenge matters: taking on something difficult and making mistakes is how we grow and learn
Mindset can be changed: just like intelligence and ability, we can develop our mindset

Grit: related to mindset

Grit = passion + perseverance
Passion: how intensely are you commited to your goals; consistency over time rather than intensity
Perseverance: tendency to not give up in the face of challenges: tenacity or persistence

Talent and skill matters to a degree
Talent = rate skill develops
Skill = talent x effort

Achievement = Skill x Effort
Achievement = Skill x Effort<sup>2</sup>

Not all effort is equal

Deliberate Practice:
Challenge: attempt something just outside your current ability
Focus: work at a high intensity, without distraction, for a short time
Feedback: learn from what you did right **and** what you did wrong
Refine: reflect on what's been learned and what still needs to be learned. Repeat this process again later.

Growth Mindset and Grit drive achievement
Learning is the goal
Challenge makes you stronger
	Effort matters most
		Higher achievement
