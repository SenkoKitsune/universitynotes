Linear independence
	Consider system with 3 variables & 3 equations
	possible number of solutions
	1) No solution
	2) Single solution
	3) A line with inf many solutions
	4) A plane with in many solutions

Restrict to the case where all planes pass through the origin

Linear independence
	$\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},...\vec{v_n}$ are vectors in R<sup>n</sup>
	$a_1,a_2,...a_n$ are scalars
	An equation of the form 
		$a_1\vec{v_1} + a_2\vec{v_2} + ... + a_n\vec{v_n} = \vec{0}$ is called a linear relation of $\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},...\vec{v_n}$
	Trivial linear relation:
		$0\vec{v_1} + 0\vec{v_2} + ... + 0\vec{v_n} = \vec{0}$
	$\vec{v_1},\vec{v_2},...\vec{v_n}$ are linearly dependant if there is a non-trivial linear relation and linearly independent if they don't admit nontrivial linear relation
If it is a combination, the determinant is zero for the vectors
