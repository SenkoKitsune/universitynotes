Suppose A gives rise to an eigenbasis $\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2, ...$ and eigenvalues $λ_1, λ_2,...$
So there are $n$ -special sets
	$e^{λ_1t}\vec{v}_1, ...$
Then any solution of $\vec{y}' = A\vec{y}$ is a linear combination of the special solutions

A linear combination of solutions is still a solution
