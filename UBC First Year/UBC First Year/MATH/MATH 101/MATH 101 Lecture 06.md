Differential equation is an equation (a formula with equality) in which the unknown that we want to find is a differentiable function

Differential equations are the language of nature
	much more common to obtain some relationship that relates the function to its rate of change

Classifying differential equations
	The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative that appears in the equation

A differential equation is autonomous if the independent variable doesn't appear in the equation

Amalgamating constants of integration
	there are several constants of integration if we deal with several indefinite integrals
	we can combine all the +Cs into one +C
		we cannot give the same name to all of the constants, as we are implying they all have the same value

A separable differential equation is one that has (or can be taken to) the form
	$\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}=f(x)g(y)$

Write $y' = f(x)g(y)$, rewrite as $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)$
	Separate and integrate
	$\displaystyle\int\frac{1}{g(y)}dy=\int f(x)dx$


A function is constant when the derivative is 0
