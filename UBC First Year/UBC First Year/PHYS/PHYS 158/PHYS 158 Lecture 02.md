	$r_1 + r_2 = d$
	$r_1 - r_2 = r_1 - (d-r_1) = 2r_1 - d$

Nodes = points at which the string never moves
Antinodes = points at which the amplitude of the string motion is the greatest

Pressure antinode = displacement node
	Particles do not move

Pressure node = displacement antinode
	

Boundary conditions
1) No end
	1) No reflection
2) Free end ( soft boundary )
	1) Reflects with the same sign
3) Fixed end ( hard boundary )
	1) Reflects with the opposite sign

Open boundary:
	Open end = pressure node = displacement antinode

Closed end = pressure antinode = displacement node
	One closed end:
		only odd harmonics are possible

$v_T = \displaystyle\sqrt{\displaystyle\frac{S}{ρ}}$
S = shear modulus

$V_L = \displaystyle\sqrt{\displaystyle\frac{Y}{ρ}}$
Y = Youngs Modulus


Beats
	Slightly mismatched frequencies will produce audible "beats"
		In some regions, they will add constructively, and in some regions they will fully destruct
	At any point the oscillations of two waves of nearby frequencies f<sub>1</sub> and f<sub>2</sub> can be described as
		$y_1 = Asin(ω_1t)$ and $y_2 = Asin(ω_2t)$ for any point x
		$y = y_1 + y_2 = Asin(ω_1t) + sin(ω_2t)$
			= $2A cos(1/2(ω_1 - ω_2)t)A sin(1/2(ω_1 - ω_2)t)$

$\displaystyle\frac{1/2(ω_1 + ω_2)}{2π} = 1/2(f_1 + f_2)$ = f<sub>avg</sub>

modulated by a beat frequency

2($\displaystyle\frac{1/2(ω_1 + ω_2)}{2π}) = (f_1 + f_2)$) = f<sub>beat</sub>

T<sub>beat</sub> = 1/2 T<sub>Ampli</sub> 
f<sub>beat</sub> = 2f<sub>Ampli</sub>
f<sub>sound</sub> = f<sub>Avg</sub>
