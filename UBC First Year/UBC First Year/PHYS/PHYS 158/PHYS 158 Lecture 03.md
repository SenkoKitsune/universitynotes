Amplitude is reflected on open ended tubes/pipe

Light waves: 

Sound waves are mechanical and therefore they require a medium to support the
Light waves can propagate in vacuum and in a medium
Speed of light in vacuum is c= 3x10^8 m/s
the speed of light in a medium depends on its index of refraction. n<sub>med</sub> -> v<sub>med</sub> = c / n<sub>med</sub>
n<sub>vacuum</sub> = 1.0 and n<sub>medium</sub> >= 1.0

the position of the maximum depends on the wavelength

A laser beam is incident on a double slit
	the 2 slits are very small and the light waves coming out of them can be assumed to be point sources emitting spherical wave fronts
	If the first maximum occurs at a distance y<sub>1</sub> , what is the distance "d" between the 2 slits?


Light in a medium
n = index of refraction
In any material, n<sub>med</sub> > 1
Same f in air and the medium
位medi = 位<sub>air</sub>/n<sub>med</sub>
f = v<sub>air</sub>/位<sub>air</sub> = v<sub>med</sub> / 位<sub>med</sub>
