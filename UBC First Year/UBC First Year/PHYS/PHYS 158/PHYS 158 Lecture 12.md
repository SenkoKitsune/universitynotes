Columba's law
	the force between two point charges
	$\displaystyle \vec{F_{21}} = \frac{1}{4πε_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2_{21}}\hat{r_{21}}$
	$\displaystyle|F| = k\frac{|q_1||q_2|}{r^3}|\vec{r}|$~$\displaystyle\frac{1}{r^2}$

How to compute the magnitude and direction properly
	1) Find the distance between the two charges
	2) Draw a line passing through the two charges
	3) The force on $Q_1$ due to $Q_2$ has its tail at location 1 and points towards location 2

$\displaystyle Q^2= \frac{2Lsin(θ/2)^2mgtan(θ/2)}{k}$

Electric fields
	Electric field at position P
		$\displaystyle \vec{E_P}(\vec{r}) = \frac{\vec{F_P}}{q}$
		E field always points in the direction that a small "positive test charge" would move (if it were there)
		Electric field is a property of space created by charges $Q_i$


Electric fields and superposition
	Define the force at point P
		Add p all force components
		$\displaystyle \vec{F_q} = \vec{F_1}+\vec{F_2} + ... + \vec{F_n}$
		"Superposition of forces"

Consider a ring to be made up of infinitesimal segments. Each segment is like a point charge source $dQ$ which produces an electric field = $\vec{dE}$

Due to the symmetry of the ring, all the E-field contributions in the x and y directions cancel out
