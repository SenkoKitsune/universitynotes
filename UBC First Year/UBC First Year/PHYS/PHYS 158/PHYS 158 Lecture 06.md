Capacitors in series
	Use reciprocal addition

Capacitors in parallel
	Use linear addition

Capacitors are opposite of resistors

Grounding the circuit does not change any of the currents. but it allows us to define specific values for the potential at each point in the circuit

This allows us to join different circuits together without any unexpected currents between them

Switches
	Switches change the characteristics of a circuit
