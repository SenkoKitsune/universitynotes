Dielectrics
Non-polar molecules
	a) In the absence of an electric field, nonpolar molecules are not electric dipoles
	b) An electric field causes the molecules' positive and negative charges to separate, making the molecule slightly polar

Polar molecules
	a) In the absence of an electric field, polar molecules orient randomly
	b) When an electric field is applied, the molecules tend to align with it

Induced charges create electric field
	weaker field in dielectric due to induced (bound) charges
	Total field is diminished
	$E\ < E_0$
	$E' = \displaystyle\frac{E_0}{K_e}$


Dielectric Induced Charge & Field
$\displaystyle E_0=\frac{σ}{ε_0}$
	Original E-field without dielectric

Use Gauss's law with all the charge
$\displaystyle \oint\oint\vec{E}\cdot dd\vec{A} = (E_0-E_{ind})A = \frac{σ-σ_i}{ε_0}A=E'A$
$\displaystyle E' = \frac{σ-σ_i}{ε_0}=\frac{E_0}{K_e}=\frac{σ}{K_eε_0}$
	Net E field with dielectric
$\displaystyle σ-σ_i=\frac{σ}{K_e}$
	$\displaystyle σ_i=σ(1-\frac{1}{K_e})$

In dielectrics, Gauss's law needs to be modified
$\displaystyle \oint K_e\vec{E}\cdot \vec{n}dA = \frac{Q_{encl}}{ε_0}=4πlQ_{encl-free}$
	only use free charge
	$K_e$ is the dielectric constant of the material and it accounts for the induced charge inside the dielectric
		dimensionless quantity, has no units

Electric field energy density
Consider a parallel plate capacity
$\displaystyle U = \frac{1}{2}CV^2=\frac{1}{2}(\frac{Aε_0}{d})V^2$
	Total stored energy in the E-field between the capacitor plates
	$d$ = distance between the plates
	Volume between the plates $V = Ad$
	Energy density = Energy/Volume
		$\displaystyle u = \frac{U}{Ad}=\frac{1}{2}V^2\frac{Aε_0}{d}\frac{1}{Ad}$
		But $\displaystyle E = \frac{V}{d}$:
			$\displaystyle u = \frac{1}{2}ε_0E^2$
		In the presence of a dielectric the result will be modified as
		$\displaystyle u = \frac{1}{2}K_eε_0E^2$

$U =$ energy, $u =$ energy density

Inserting a dielectric increases capacitance of a capacitor
	$\displaystyle C_0=\frac{Q}{V_0}$
	$\displaystyle C = \frac{Q}{V} = \frac{Q}{\frac{V_0}{K}}$
	$C = K_eC_0$

Energy stored in a capacitor
	$\displaystyle U = \frac{Q^2}{2C}$
		stored energy decreases because insertion of the dielectric increases the capacitance

Dielectrics are pulled into a capacitor by force $\displaystyle F_x = \frac{-dU}{dx}$
	$\displaystyle U = \int dq[\frac{q}{C}] = \frac{1}{2}\frac{Q62}{C}$
		Assume constant Q (disconnect the battery)
		C increases when dielectric is inserted
			U goes down
	Fringe fields
		Will be bound negative charges on positive surface
		Will be bound positive charges on negative surface
	Fringe electric field pulls dielectric into the gap


Magnetism: force on charged particle
	We define magnetic field $\vec{B}$ by its fundamental effect on a moving charged particle
	$\vec{F} = q\vec{v}\times\vec{B}$

There are no magnetic charges (monopoles) The most basic magnetic unit is a dipole
The magnetic field lines always exit from the North pole and they always enter at the South pole
Units are the Tesla, T
	Since 1 Tesla magnetic field is very large, $\vec{B}$ is sometimes measured in Gauss, denoted in G
		$1 T = 10^4 G$

Force and work done by $\vec{B}$-Field
	$\displaystyle W = \int\vec{F}\cdot\vec{dr}=\int q(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})\cdot \vec{dr}$
		by definition $\vec{dr}=\vec{v}dt$
		$\displaystyle W = \int q(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})\cdot\vec{v}dt$
		$(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})\cdot\vec{v} = 0$ because the angle between $(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})$ and $\vec{v}$ is $990^o$
Motion of a particle in a B-field
Since a charged particle feels a force due to the magnetic field, the acceleration is not zero
	The only way speed can be constant is if the particle moves in a circle
	$\displaystyle \vec{F}=q\vec{E}+q(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})$
		The formula is called the Lorentz force law
