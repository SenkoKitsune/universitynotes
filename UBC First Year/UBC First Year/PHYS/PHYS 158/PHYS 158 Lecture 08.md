Inductors 
	passive electrical component that can store energy in the magnetic field inside the coil

Inductance
	When the current in an inductor changes it produces an induced EMF in a direction which tries to oppose the change
	$V_L = ε_L = -L \displaystyle\frac{di}{dt}$
		[L] = Henry

Energy in a capacitor is stored in the electric field
Energy in an inductor is stored in the magnetic field

Inductors can act like a battery or like a wire, but not at the same time

Inductors try to preserve the "status quo" of the system

Energy storage in inductors
If we build up the current, starting from $I_0 = 0$ (initial) -> $I_F$ (final) at the time t when we have achieved a current i, we have to work against an opposing 
	EMF = -L $\displaystyle\frac{di}{dt}$
	In order to achieve a further increase in current, so our energy source is doing work per unit time
	$P = iV = (i L \displaystyle\frac{di}{Dt}$)
Total work done
	$\displaystyle\int P dt = \displaystyle\int iL \displaystyle\frac{di}{dt} dt$

ie Energy stored in system
	$\displaystyle\int_{0}^{I_F} iL \displaystyle\frac{di}{dt} dt$

$U_L = (1/2) L I_F^2$

R-L circuit
L = inductor, R = battery
Current is now free to flow in the circuit but there is a back EMF induced i L which opposes the change in current
	t=0+, i(0+) = 0: inductor acts as a battery
	After a long time, i(∞) = V/R

 LED: light emitting diode
	 a light-bulb that glows for one direction of current

Time dependence of R-L circuits
	sing the loop rules
	$ε_L - iR = 0 = -L\displaystyle\frac{di}{dt} - iR = 0$
	We can solve using the method we presented for discharging capacitor
	$i(t) = \displaystyle i(0)e^{-(\displaystyle\frac{Rt}{K})}$
	emf = -L $\displaystyle\frac{di}{dt}$ and $\displaystyle\frac{di}{dt} < 0$

Using loop rules
$V-iR-L\displaystyle\frac{di}{dt} = 0$
We can solve the method for the charging capacitor
