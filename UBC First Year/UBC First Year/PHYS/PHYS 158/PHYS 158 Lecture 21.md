Two straight wires with opposite currents
	Magnetic dipole field
	$B_1$ and $B_2$ add in central region
	$B_1$ and $B_2$ cancel out in the outer regions

Solenoid
	Magnetic field outside the "tube" of the solenoid is zero for a long solenoid
	From symmetry, the B-field inside the solenoid is parallel to its axis
		The B-field outside the solenoid is very small except near the ends
	$\displaystyle \oint\vec{B}\cdot d\vec{l} = B_{in}L = μ_0I_{encl}$
		$I_{encl}=InL$
		$B_{in}=μ_0In$
Finite length solenoid
	$B_x$ on the axis of a circular loop
		$\displaystyle B_x = \frac{μ_0}{4π}\frac{I(2πa)a}{(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}=\frac{μ_0}{2}\frac{Ia^3}{(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}$
	Each loop has a current I, so for each loop
		$\displaystyle dB_x = \frac{μ_0}{2}\frac{Ndx}{L}\frac{Ia^2}{(x^2+a^2)^{3/2}}$
		$\displaystyle B = \frac{μ_0}{2} \frac{IN_{total}}{L}\left\{ \sinΦ - \frac{x}{\sqrt{a^2+x^2}} \right\} \left|_{X_L}^{X_R}\right.$
	$\displaystyle \sinΦ_{R,L}=(\frac{x_{R,L}}{\sqrt{a^2+x^2_{R,L}}}) = \pm cosθ_{R,L}$
		$\displaystyle B = \frac{μ_0}{2}I\frac{n-N_{total}}{L}(cosθ_R-cosθ_L)$

Faraday's law
	$\displaystyle ε = \oint \vec{E}\cdot d\vec{l} = -\frac{dΦ_B}{dt}$
		closed path with an enclosed area
	A changing magnetic flux creates an induced E field and therefore an induced EMF

Lenz's law:
	A changing magnetic flux generates an induced current which then creates an induced magnetic field which tries to maintain the status quo situation

Induced EMF in a circuit given by
	$\displaystyle ε = -\frac{dΦ_B}{dt}$
	when the magnetic flux through the circuit loop changes

Faraday's law is valid even if $Φ_Β$ changes because of a time dependent B-field (or Area) without any relative motion
