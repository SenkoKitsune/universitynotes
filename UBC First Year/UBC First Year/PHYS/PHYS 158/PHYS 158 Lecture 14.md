$\displaystyle Φ_{electric} = \oint\oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{enclosed}}{e_0}$
The integral is hard unless there is symmetry
	Spherical: charge only depends on r, not θ or φ
	Planar: charge only depends on $z$, not $x$ or $y$

$\displaystyle E = \frac{σ}{2ε_0}$
	independent of $d$
	σ = charge density

Ring of charge
$\displaystyle E_Z = \int dE_z = \int(\frac{khdQ}{(R^2+h^2)^{3/2}} = (\frac{kh}{(R^2+h^2)^{3/2}})$
$\displaystyle E_Z = \frac{khQ}{(R^2+h^2)^{3/2}}$

Uniformly charged planar disc
Think of a planar disc as a sequence of concentric rings and just add up the fiels form all of these rings
	$\displaystyle dQ_{ring} = \frac{Q_{disc}}{πR^2_{disc}}$
	$\displaystyle E_{disc}(x) = (\frac{2k_cQ_{disc}}{R^2_{disc}})(\frac{1-x}{\sqrt{R^2_{disc}+x^2)}})$

Cylindrical Symmetry
	charge distribution is symmetric along an axis and around an axis
	For the full symmetry, the axis must be infinitely long, so the charge is infinite
		Charge per length $\displaystyle λ = \frac{Q}{L}$


Gauss with cylindrical symmetry
	Infinite line of charge
		$\displaystyle Q_L = (constant * L) = λL$
			Charge contained in length $L$
	The electric field has cylindrical symmetry
	$\displaystyle \frac{Q_{encl}}{ε_0} - \oint\vec{E}\cdot d\vec{A} = E2πr$
	$\displaystyle E = \frac{Q_{encl}}{2πrLε_0} = \frac{λ}{2πrε_0}$

Conductors
	A conductor is any material in which the charges are free to move
	1) There is no net charge inside a conductor ($\displaystyle Q_{net} = 0)$
	2) There is no electric field inside a conductor ($\displaystyle E_{net} = 0)$
	   If there is a non-zero E field then $\displaystyle F = qE$ implies there is a net force which means moving charges
		   We would observe currents in conductors which is not true
			   we have static situation (after we reach equilibrium)

Cavity in a conductor
	If conductivity does not guarantee that $\displaystyle \vec{E} = 0$ inside the cavity
	How to calculate
		Graw a Gaussian surface just outside the cavity
		Conductivity makes $\vec{E} = 0$ on that surface, so if there is no charge enclosed in the cavity, then $\displaystyle \vec{E} = 0$ inside the cavity

Cavity with a charge inside
	Consider a uncharged conductor with a cavity and a hole from the outside world to the cavity
	Move a positive charge without touching the conductor and close the conducting door over the hole
		The positive charge attracts negative charge to the surface of the cavity
		A Gaussian surface around the cavity has $\displaystyle \vec{E} = 0$
		There must be an equal positive charge in the conductor, which must be on the outer surface

Surface E-field vs shape
	A conducting sphere of radius $R$ has a capacitance "relative to infinity" of $\displaystyle C = 4πε_0R$
	So if it has charge $Q$, it has voltage
		$\displaystyle V = \frac{Q}{C} - \frac{Q}{{4πε_0R^2}}$
	The surface electric field $\displaystyle E = \frac{Q}{4πε_0R^2}$
		$\displaystyle E = \frac{V}{R}$
	If we connect a large charged sphere to a smaller sphere with a wire, the charges rearrange until the spheres have the same V
		The sphere with the smaller radius will have a higher surface electric field, and thus surface charge density

Summary
	The electric field is zero inside a conductor
	Any charge is distributed on the surfaces
	Electric field outside a conductor is perpendicular to the surface
		magnitude: $\displaystyle E = \frac{σ}{ε_0}$
	Surface charge density is greatest when the radius of curvature is the smallest
