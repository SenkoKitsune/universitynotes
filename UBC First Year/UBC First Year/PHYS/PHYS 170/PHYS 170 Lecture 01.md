Rigid Bodies: things that do not change shape
	Statics and dynamics
	point particles are further specializations

Deformable Bodies: things that do change shape

Fluids
	Incompressible and compressible

Basic quantities: length, time, mass, force
	Only three of the four are independent, take, length, time, and one of mass and force to be fundamental


Universal law of Gravitation
 $F_g = G m_1m_2/r^2$
