In a concurrent force systems all lines of action of the forces intersect some point O
	There are no moments produced about this point, and the system can be equivalently represented bu the single resultant force $\vec{F_R}$ = ΣF at O

Co-planar force system
	All the lines of action of the $\vec{F_i}$ lie in a single plane so resultant force $F_R$= ΣF lies in the plane as well. Also, all moments about O are perpendicular to the plane so the resultant moment $(\vec{M_R})_O$ and $\vec{F_R}$ are perpendicular. 
		$(\vec{M_R})_O$ can be replaced by moving $\vec{F_R}$ a perpendicular distance D = $(\vec{M_R})_O/F_R$ away from O so that $\vec{F_R}$ generates the same moment about O

Parallel force system
	The location of the forces don't matter
		rearrange each force to be in the plane
	eg) All the forces are parallel to the z axis
		The resultant force at $\vec{F_R}$ = ΣF at point O is also parallel to it
		Moment due to each force lies in the plane of the plate so the resultant couple moment $(\vec{M_R})_O$ also lie in that plane, along some moment axis a ($\vec{F_R}$ and $(\vec{M_R})_O$ are perpendicular)
		Can be further reduced by moving $\vec{F_R}$ a distance d = $(\vec{M_R})_O$/$\vec{F_R}$ along an axis b that is perpendicular to a to a point P, so that the resulting moment of $\vec{F_R}$ about O is $(\vec{M_R})_O$
