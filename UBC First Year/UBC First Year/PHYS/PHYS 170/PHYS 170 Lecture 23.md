Time derivatives
Particle path is given in the form $r = f(θ) = f(θ(t))$
	We must use chain rule to compute the relationship between the radial and angular(transverse) derivatives

Absolute dependent motion
Consider situation where motion of one particle is dependent on motion of another
Main application we will consider is a general system of pulleys and blocks

Datum: convenient location from which a displacement is measured
Two position coordinates $S_A$ and $S_B$ are related by
	$S_A + l_{CD} + S_B = l_T$
		$L_{CD}$ is the length of the rope from C to D and $l_T$ is the length of rope are constant lengths
		Differentiating the above with respect to time:
			$\vec{v}_A + \vec{v}_B = 0$ or $\vec{v}_B = -\vec{v}_A$

Two types of equations
	Rope equations: based of the fact that the total length of the rope in a pulley system is constant
	Path equations: relate the displacement of one or more blocks to a sequence(path) of one or more segments of rope

For both types of equations, we make use of the fact that certain segments of rope are of constant length
	eg) segments that are wrapped around a pulley wheel
