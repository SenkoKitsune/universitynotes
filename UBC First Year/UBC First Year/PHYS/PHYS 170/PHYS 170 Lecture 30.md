Principle of work and energy applied to a weight
Work done by a weight as particle moves from $s_1$ to $s_2$
	$U_{1-2}=-WÎ”y=-W(y_2-y_1)$
	Principle of work00energy assuming weight is the only force acting on the particle
	$T_1+U_{1-2}=T_2$
		$T_1-W(y_2-y_1)=T_2$
	$T_1+Wy_1=T_2+WY_2$

$T_1+mgh_1=T_2+mgh_2$

Conservative forces and potential energy
	A force is called conservative if the work that it does on a particle as the particle moves is independent of the path
		work only depends on the location of the initial and final points

Weight:
	Work done by weight is independent of the path since it only depends on the relative vertical displacement of the initial and final points

Elastic Spring Force:
	Work done by an elastic spring is independent of the path since it only depends on how much the spring is extended or compressed as the particle to which the spring is attached moves from its initial to its final point

Potential energy
	One way of defining energy is the capacity to do work
	1) Kinetic energy: energy associated with motion
	2) Potential energy: energy associated with position
Energy related with the position of a particle is measured relative to a fixed datum or reference plane
	Used to measure how much work a conservative force does on a particle when it moves from a specific location to the datum

Relation to work
	The work $U_{1-2}$ done by conservative forces when a particle moves from positions can be expressed as the difference in potential functions at the two points
		$U_{1-2} = V_1-V_2$
