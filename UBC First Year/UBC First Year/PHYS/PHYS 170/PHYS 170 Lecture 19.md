Position
	Use a single coordinate axis, s, with origin at O
	Position vector $\vec{r}$ is always along the axis

Displacement
	Change in position
	Vector: Δ$\vec{r} = \vec{r'}-\vec{r}$
	Scalar: Δs = s' - s
	Displacement is a vectoral quantity

Velocity
	Rate of change of position with respect to time
	$\vec{v}_{avg} = \displaystyle\frac{Δ\vec{r}}{Δt}$
