Newton's second law for a particle of mass $m$ subjected to a single unbalanced force
	$\vec{F}=ma$


FPS system
Weight is specified in lb
Standard value of g :$32.2ft/s^2$
Mass is measured in slugs and is computed form the second law
	$\displaystyle m=\frac{W}{g}$

Equation of motion is then
	$\displaystyle \sum\vec{F} = m\vec{A}$

$\sum F_x = ma_x, \sum F_y = ma_y, \sum F_z = ma_z$

Frictional forces
The kinetic frictional equation must be used for a particle (body) moving across a rough surface
	$F_k = μ_kN$
	Where $μ_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction and $N$ is the normal force
