Relative motion of two particles using translating axes

In some instances, it is more convenient to use two or more reference frames which are translating with respect to each tother
	$xyz$ coordinate system is referred to as the fixed reference axis

$\vec{r}_A$: absolute position of observer A
	position with respect to fixed frame

$\vec{r}_B$: absolute position of observer B
The position of B relative to A is given by:
	$\vec{r}_{B/A} = \vec{r}$
