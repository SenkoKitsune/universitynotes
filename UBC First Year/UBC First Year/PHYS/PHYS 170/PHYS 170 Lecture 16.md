Dry friction
Friction: force of resistance action on a body that prevents/retards slipping of body relative to another body or surface with which it is in contact
	force always acts tangent to surface at point of contact
	direction of force opposes possible/actual motion of body relative to contact points

Two general types of friction
	Fluid friction: contacting surfaces separated by film of fluid
	Dry friction: no lubricating fluid between surfaces of body in contact

Theory of dry friction
	must take into account deformations of surfaces of contact
		surfaces cannot be considered rigid
	Friction develops as a result of interlocking contacts between irregularities in surfaces
	Each contact results in a reactive force $ΔR_n$ which has a frictional component $ΔF_n$ and a normal component $ΔN_n$
		n labels the microscopic contact, Δ stresses that we are considering small scale forces
		$ΔR_n = ΔF_n + ΔN_n$

We can define a normal force as a force of reaction due to the contact of 2 bodies, and which acts perpendicularly to the point/surface of contact

Simplifying assumptions
	can analyse friction effects by replacing loading due to all of the microscopic reactions with resultant vectors
$\displaystyle F = \sum_{n} ΔF_n$
$\displaystyle N = \sum_{n} ΔN_n$

Just about to move
	F = μM
Equilibrium
	Assume the block is in equilibrium
	1) F acts tangentially to surface and opposes P
	2) N acts normally (perpendicular) to surface and is directed upwards to balance W
	We can determine where N acts by considering moment equilibrium about point O
	$Wx = Ph$ (counter clockwise and clockwise moments balance)
	When $x=a/2$, the normal forces acts at the right corner of the block, and block is on verge of tipping

Impending motion
	Depending on circumstances, frictional force F may not be large enough to balance P
	In this case, the block slips before it tips
	Imagine slowly increase P from 0
		F also slowly increases but only to some maximum value F_s
		F_s is known as the limiting static frictional force
			any further increase in P causes block to slip
			F_s = μ_sN
				μ_s = coefficient of static friction

When the block is on the verge of slipping, the normal force N and the friction force $F_s$ yield a resultant
	$R = N+F_s$
This makes an angle Φ with the vertical
	$Φ_s$ = $\displaystyle tan^{-1}(\frac{F_s}{N})= tan^{-1}(\frac{μ_sN}{N})=tan^{-1}(μ_s)$
	$Φ_s$ is known as the angle of static friction
Increase pulling force so that$ P > F_s$ causes a decrease in the frictional force to a value $F_k$, known as the kinetic frictional force ($F_k<F_s$)

When this occurs, the block will not be in equilibrium, so will begin to slide with some acceleration
$F_k=μ_kN$
	$μ_k$ is known as the coefficient of kinetic friction, and tends to be 25% smaller than μ_s
	$\displaystyle Φ_k = tan^{-1}(\frac{F_k}{N}) = tan^{-1}(\frac{μ_kN}{N}) = tan^{-1}({μ_k})$

Maximum static friction force is assumed to be independent of contact area

1) Equilibrium
	1) Strict equilibrium, no motion or impending motion
	2) Total number of unknowns must equal total number of available equilibrium equations

2) Impending motion at all points(all interfaces
	1) Total number of unknowns will equal the total number of available equilibrium equations, plus the total number of available frictional equations
		1) $F_s = μ_sN$ Motion impending
		2) $F_k = μ_kN$ Body slipping

3) Impending motion at some points
	1) total number of unknowns will be less than the total number of available equilibrium equations, plus the total number of available frictional equations or conditional equations for tipping
	2) part of the problem will involve figuring out which motion occurs, or is about to occur

Equilibrium vs Frictional Equations
	recall that the direction of frictional force, F, always opposes motion of body over surface
	In equilibrium problems, we can assume the direction of the force
		whenever F = μN is used, we cannot assume the direction, so F must always be shown with the proper direction in the FBD
