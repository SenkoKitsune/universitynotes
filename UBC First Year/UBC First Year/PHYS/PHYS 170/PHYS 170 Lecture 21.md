We construct a coordinate system $(t,n)$ for (tangential, normal), which has an instantaneous origin at the particle position P
	The t-axis is tangent to the curve, and has positive sense in the direction of increasing s
	Associated with this direction is a unit vector $vec{u_t}$
	The n-axis is perpendicular to the t-axis and has positive sense towards 


Radius of curvature & Centre to curvature
	We can view curved particle path as being comprised of differential arc segments $ds$, each of which with radius, ρ, known as raidus of curvature, and with centre $O'$, known as centre of curvature

For precisely circular path with radius R, $ρ= R$
In the limit of a straight path, $ρ\to \infty$
In 2D, it is convenient to express the particle path as $y=f(x)$\
	$\displaystyle ρ = \frac{1+(\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}))^{3/2}}{\displaystyle\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}}$

Position
	the n-axis is always positive on the concave side of the path
		if path is straight, orientation of n is arbitrary
