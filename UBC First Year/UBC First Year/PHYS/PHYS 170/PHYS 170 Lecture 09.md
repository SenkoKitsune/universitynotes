Forces are translations in objects
A moment
Magnitude
M<sub>o</sub> = $Fd$
	d is known as the moment arm:
		note the perpendicular distance to the axis
		Si units of moments: Nm
	momentum is perpendicular to plane containing F and d

If systems of forces is confined to $xy$ plane, all moments about Point O in the plane will be directed along the Z

Cross-product is not commutative
$A\times B \neq B \times A$
Instead
$A \times B = -B \times A$
