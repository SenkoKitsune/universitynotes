Wedge: simple machine (inclined plane) that can convert applied force, P, to larger forces acting at approximately right angles to P
The wedge is characterized by a wedge angle Î¸

Impending motion at all three contact surfaces

There is no tendency for the wedge or block to rotate

If P = 0, the block/wedge system is in equilibrium, then the wedge is called self-locking
