Scalars
	Quantities characterised by positive and negative number
		mass, volume, length
Vectors
	Quantities that have both magnitude and direction
		position, force, moment
	Notation for vectors
		**A** or $\displaystyle\vec{A}$
	Notation for magnitude (length) of vector
		*A* or $|\displaystyle\vec{A}|$


Line of action: 
	line along the orientation of vector
	extends to infinity both ways

Counterpart of a vector goes in the other direction with same magnitude

Vector addition
	Tails together: parallelogram
		the diagonal is the resultant vector
	 Tip to tail: triangle construction
		 The hypotenuse is the resultant vector

Sense = direction the vector is pointing

Resolution of vector
	express vectors as sum of two component vectors
		inverse parallelogram law

Rectangular components:
	components on x and y axis

F<sub>x</sub> = F cosθ
F<sub>y</sub> = F sinθ

Slope triangle

F<sub>x</sub>/F = a/c
F<sub>y</sub> /F= b/c

Cartesian Vector Notation
Introduces s and y coordinate axes (orientation arbitrary)
Define unit vectors in positive x and y directions
	**i** and **j**
	$\displaystyle\vec{i}$ and $\displaystyle\vec{j}$
	$\displaystyle\hat{i}$ and $\displaystyle\hat{j}$

Components of resultants, such as F<sub>R<sub>x</sub></sub>, F<sub>R<sub>y</sub></sub>  are not necessarily positive

General case
F<sub>R<sub>x</sub></sub> = ΣF<sub>x</sub>
F<sub>R<sub>y</sub></sub> = ΣF<sub>y</sub>
