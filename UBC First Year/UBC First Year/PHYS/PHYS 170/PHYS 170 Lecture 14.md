Moment of a couple
	Couple: two parallel forces with the same magnitude pointed in opposite directions, separated by perpendicular distance d
	Resultant force (net force) due to couple is zero, so only effect of couple is to produce rotation or tendency for rotation in some direction
	Couple moment: the moment produced by a couple

The couple moment is independent of point about which moments are computed

Moments about O
	$\vec{M} = \vec{r_A}\times (-\vec{F}) + \vec{r_B}\times\vec{F}$
	Assume point is independent of the pivot point; more easily compute $\vec{M}$ by taking moments about *A*. Moment of -$\vec{F}$ about *A* vanishes so
		$\vec{M}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$


Scalar formulation
	*M* = F d
	Direction is given by the right hand rule

Vector formulation
	Using vector cross product
		$\vec{M} = \vec{r}\times\vec{F}$
		$\vec{r}$ is an arbitrary vector from the line of action of -$\vec{F}$ to line of action of $\vec{F}$

Couple moments as free vectors
	Because couple moment are independent of pivot point, so it can be viewed as free vector
		can act on any point

Equivalent couples
	two couples are equivalent if they produce the same moment. Since direction of couple moment is always perpendicular to the plane containing the couple
		equivalent couples must either lie in the same plane or in parallel planes

resultant couple moment
	since couple moments are free vectors, the can be added
		$\vec{M_R} = \vec{M_1} + \vec{M_2}$
	For a general system
		$\vec{M_R} = Î£(\vec{r}\times\vec{F})$

Force has potential to both translate and rotate a body, and the amount it does these depends on where and how the force is applied
	have to have identical physical effects

For points on line of action
	We can translate or transmit a force to any point in the body that lies along the line of action of the force, and an equivalent system will result

Point O is not on the line of action
	Proceed via intermediate step in which we introduce $\vec{F}$ and -$\vec{F}$ at point O
	Now note that $\vec{F}$ at and and -$\vec{F}$ at O form a couple moment, M, defined by
		$vec{M} = \vec{r}\times\vec{F}$
	Couple moment is a free vector, so can be located any point P on the body
	Combined system p of force relocated to O and couple moment located at arbitrary point, P, is equivalent tot eh original force applied at point P

Resultant of a force and couple system
	To study external effects of system, replace system by equivalent single resultant force acting at some point, O, and a resultant couple moment
	$\vec{F_R}$ is independent of location O in body
	$\vec{M_{R_O}}$  and other moments are not independent of location O
	Nonetheless, $\vec{M_{R_O}}$ is a free vector so can be applied at any point
