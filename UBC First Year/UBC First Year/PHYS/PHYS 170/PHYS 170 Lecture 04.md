Direction of a cartesian vector
	Coordinate direction angles
		α, β, γ
	as measured between the tail of the vector and the 

cosα = A<sub>x</sub>/A, cosβ A<sub>y</sub>/A, cosγ = A<sub>z</sub>/A

$\vec{u}_A = \displaystyle\frac{\vec{A}}{A} = \displaystyle\frac{A_x}{A} \hat{i} + \displaystyle\frac{A_y}{A} \hat{j} + \frac{A_z}{A} \hat{k}$
$\vec{u}_a = cosα\hat{i} + cosβ\hat{j} + cosγ\hat{k}$
$cos^2α + cos^2β + cos^2γ = 1$

$\vec{A} = A\vec{u}_A$
$A = A_x\hat{i} + A_y\hat{j} + A_x\hat{k}$

Concurrent force systems
	Can extend this technique of vector addition to system of an arbitrary number of concurrent forces
		General equation:
		$\vec{F}_R = ΣF = ΣF_x\hat{i} + ΣF_y\hat{j} + ΣF_z\hat{k}$

Get projection in the XY-plane to get the hypotenuse. Can resolve the hypotenuse in two directions

$|F'| = |\vec{F}|cosθ$ , θ = angle from XY-plane to vector
$F_x = |\vec{F}'| cosθ$, θ= angle between X-axis and projection of vector onto the XY-plane
$F_y = |\vec{F}'| sinθ$ θ = angle between X-axis ad projection of vector onto the XY-plane
	To project, we need a right angle
