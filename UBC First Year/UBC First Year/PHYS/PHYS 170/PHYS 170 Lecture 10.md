Moment of a force: vector formulation

Moment of force F about moment axis passing through O and perpendicular to plane containing O and F is given by
M<sub>O</sub> = $\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$
Important: r is a position vector drawn from O to any point lying on the line of action of F
If O lies on the plane of action of F, then moment of F about O vanishes
Frequently refer to point O as the pivot point

Magnitude: treat r as "sliding vector" to move it to line of action F so that angle θ is determined properly
	Magnitude of moment is
	M<sub>O</sub> = $\vec{r}\vec{F}$sinθ
	Μ<sub>O</sub> = $\vec{F}(\vec{r}sinθ) = Fd$
	d is the moment arm, agrees with original definition


Principle of transmissibility
	
Equation for moment about O due to force F
	M<sub>O</sub> = $\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$
	Position vector r can join O and any point of F
Force can be treated as a sliding vector and can be relocated so that its tail is at an arbitrary point on its line of action


Resultant moment of system of forces
	More than one force acts on a body, resultant moment of forces bout a point O is the vector sum of individual moments about O
	M<sub>R<sub>O</sub></sub> = Σ$\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$

Moment about a specified axis
M<Sub>a</sub> =$M_O\cdot\vec{u}_a = \vec{u}_a\cdot M_O= \vec{u}_a\cdot(\vec{r}\times\vec{F})$
u<sub>a</sub> = unit direction in direction of axis a

Force is parallel to axis of interest, Moment is 0
