Equilibrium of a rigid body

Condition for rigid body equilibrium
	Rigid body: body which does not deform when subjected to loads (forces, moments). Idealization, but good one for many engineering materials
	View rigid bodies being composed of particles with interaction between adjacent particles

Arbitrary system of external forces can always be replaced by an equivalent resultant force and couple moment acting at some arbitrary point, O, typically located within the body
	If the resultant force and resultant couple moment both vanish, then we say that the body is in equilibrium

$\vec{F_R} = Σ\vec{F} = 0$
$\vec{(M_R)_O} = Σ\vec{M} = 0$
These equations are necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for equilibrium


Free-body diagram
	We will be considering rigid bodies that are acted on by a variety of forces and moments
		these bodies will typically be supported in various ways
		particulars of the forces and moments will depend on the nature of supports


In general
	A force is developed by a support that restricts the translation of its attached member
	A couple moment is developed when rotation of the attached member is prevented
