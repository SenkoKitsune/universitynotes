Refrigerators

Can transfer heat from colder system to warmer system by doing work

refrigerator: heat engine in reverse

A refrigerator takes cheat from a cold place (inside) and gives it off to a warmer place
An input of mechanical work is required to do this

Coefficient of performance
Ratio is |Q<sub>C</sub>| / |W|

We call this ratio the coefficient of performance, K
Coefficient of performance: K = |Q<sub>C</sub>| / |W| = heat removed from inside fridge / work we put in
	Q<sub>C</sub> /Q<sub>H</sub> - Q<sub>C</sub>

Typical COP ~ 3-4
