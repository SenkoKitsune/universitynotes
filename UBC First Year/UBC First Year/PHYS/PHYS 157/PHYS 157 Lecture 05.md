Thermal expansion

ΔL = αL<sub>0</sub>ΔT
ΔL/L<sub>0</sub> = αΔT
α is the coefficient of linear expansion
units of α are K<sup>-1</sup>
assumes ΔL/L<sub>0</sub> is small

Why do materials usually expand when heated
	rigid body:
		interaction between molecules is like a spring
			potential energy = spring
		The spring force is proportional to the distance
			linear dependence in change in position and force
			the relation between potential and potential
				force = -d/dx potential
					only an approximation at higher energies
	there is only discreet states
		energy eigen state:
			ground state
			cannot be in between states
			can occupy states with certain probability
	effect of the asymmetry of the potential

For moderate temperature changes ΔL is directly proportional to ΔT

ΔL is also directly proportional of L<sub>0</sub>
Hole in a surface grows in proportion to plate (Same as if hole were filled)
	Keeps the geometric shape when expanding and shrinking
β is the coefficient of volume expansion

Linear and volume coefficient
	β is 3 times larger than α
Original volume L<sup>3</sup>

New volume = 1.001 x L<sup>3</sup> = 1.003 x L<sup>3</sup>

More generally: (L + ΔL)<sup>3</sup> = L<sup>3</sup> + 3L<sup>2</sup>ΔL +
