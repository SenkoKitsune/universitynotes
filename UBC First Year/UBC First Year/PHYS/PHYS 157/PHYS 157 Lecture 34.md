Consequence of superposition

If D<sub>P</sub><sup>(1)</sup> (x, t) is in phase with D<sub>P</sub><sup>(2)</sup>(x, t), it is constructive interference
If D<sub>P</sub><sup>(1)</sup> (x, t) is out of phase with D<sub>P</sub><sup>(2)</sup>(x, t), it is destructive interference

D<sub>P</sup> = D<sub>P</sub><sup>(1)</sup> (x, t) + D<sub>P</sub><sup>(2)</sup>(x, t)

Constructive interference: 
0<sup>o</sup> difference if sources are in phase

Destructive interreference:
	180<sup>o</sup> phase difference if sources are out of phase
	Only total if A<sub>1</sub> = A<sub>2</sub>


Nodal and anti-nodal curves
	different locations in space where wave is intensified and cancelled


The sources have the same phase
	Waves interfere constructively if their path lengths differ by an integral number of wavelengths: r<sub>2</sub> - r<sub>1</sub> = mλ
	Waves interfere destructively if their path lengths differ by half-integral number of wavelengths: r<sub>2</sub> - r<sub>1</sub> = (m + 1/2)λ
	
If sources are out of phase with π
	Waves interfere constructively if their path lengths differ by a half-integral number of wavelengths: r<sub>2</sub> - r<sub>1</sub> = (m + 1/2)λ
	Waves interfere destructively if their path lengths differ by an integral number of wavelengths: r<sub>2</sub> - r<sub>1</sub> = mλ

anti-nodal curves are all positions where constructive interference occurs

nodal curves are where destructive interference occurs

Path difference = d
d = n λ
λ = d/n
f = v/λ = (n / d) v

The intensity of a wave is the average power it carries per unit area
For a plane wave, the intensity stays the same as the waves travel
If waves spread out uniformly in all directions and no energy is absorbed
	the intensity I at any distance r must fall of like 1/ r<sup>2</sup> from energy conservation, so I ∝ 1/r<sup>2</sup>
	the same power over a greater area
