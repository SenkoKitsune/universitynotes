length of pendulum will effect frequency

coupled oscillators
	disturbance propagates along the chain
	energy is transferred to the other oscillators
		previous will settle down to equilibrium position
	with a periodic drive (continuously adding energy to the system)
		we get a travelling wave


Transverse wave: oscillations perpendicular to direction wave travels

Longitudinal wave: oscillations parallel to direction wave travels

Many physical systems act as coupled oscillators
	Solids
		each atom is in an equilibrium position, similar to a lot of coupled oscillators
		F<sub>net</sub> = 0

Snapshot graph
	D(x) = A cos(kx + Φ)
	wave number k = 2π/λ

constant velocity, wave depends on x: position dependence
