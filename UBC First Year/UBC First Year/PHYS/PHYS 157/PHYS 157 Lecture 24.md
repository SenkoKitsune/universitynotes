Mechanical equilibrium occurs when forces and torques on each part of the system add to zero

eg) F<sub>gas</sub> + F<sub>gravity</sub> + F<sub>air</sub> = 0
Piston is in equilibrium

There are two equilibriums
	Unstable equilibrium: near impossible to maintain
	Stable equilibrium

Restoring force
For a stable equilibrium configuration, a displacement in one direction leads to a net force in the other direction
	Springs:
		Equilibrium: the spring is neither stretched nor compressed
		Stretched, Δx > 0, F<sub>spring</sub> < 0
		Compressed Δx < 0, F<sub>spring</sub> > 0

Oscillations
Restoring forces result in Periodic Motion

For an object in a stable equilibrium configuration, draw some possible graphs of the net force on the object as a function of the displacement Δx
	Hooke's law applies to almost any system perturbed a small amount from stable equilibrium
F = -k x
F is the restoring force
x is the displacement

Exact for an "idea" spring 

Larger spring constant = smaller displacement

F = -k x and F = m a

Gives -k x = m a

Solve for a = d<sup>2</sup>x / dt<sup>2</sup>

d<sup>2</sup>x / dt<sup>2</sup> = (-k/m) x = -ω<sup>2</sup>x
where ω = (k/m)<sup>1/2</sup>

Math: most general function with this property is 
x(t) = A cos(ωt + Φ)

Φ = phase
