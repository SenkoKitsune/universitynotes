Entropy

Why does thermodynamic processes have directions?

Systems move from an orderly state (low entropy) to disorderly state (high entropy)
Entropy is a measure for disorder in a system

Binomial coefficient
	n!/(r! (n-r)!)

Energy is exchanged between nearby molecules via random processes
Vastly more configurations where energy is distributed more evenly between both sides
Heat(energy) will almost certainly flow from higher temperature (higher energy density) side to lower temperature (lower energy density) side.

evolution of system = walk through configuration space

Entropy is the measure of how many possible microscopic configurations there are for a specified set of macroscopic variables
	Macroscopic variables ( or macroscopic configuration) means
		eg) distribution of frogs
		eg) a gas with pressure P, volume V, temperature T
			Define entropy of a macroscopic configuration as
				S = (constant x)(ln[N])
					constant x is the Boltzmann constant
					N is the number of microscopic configurations of a certain macroscopic configuration
					

Second Law of Thermodynamics

Total entropy in a system never decreases
	probability of decrease is vanishingly small

Macroscopic definition of entropy

dS = dQ / T

dS is the change in entropy when dQ of heat is added to a system at temperature T
	Units of S are Joules/Kelvin
We can prove this from the microscopic definition of S

dS = dS<sub>1</sub> + dS<sub>2</sub> means entropy S is an *additive* property

Area under a T-S diagram is Q
