Internal energy is property of state
Heat depends on path


Adiabatic processes
Two cases:
	1) Gas is well insulated from environment
	2) Process happens very quickly, so not enough time for significant heat transfer

First law: ΔU = -W
	(compressed gas heats up)

ΔU = nC<sub>v</sub>ΔT = -W
Idea Gas Law: PV/T is constant

Combining these:
	PV<sup>γ</sup> = constant
	TV<sup>γ-1</sub> = constant
	γ = C<sub>p</sub>/C<sub>v</sub>
	P ∝ 1/V<sup>γ</sup>

C<sub>v</sub> = ((number of degrees of freedom) / 2 )R
Monoatomic idea gas: γ = 5/3 ≈ 1.67
Diatomic gas: γ = 7/5 ≈ 1.40

Adiabatic processes are steeper than isothermal (γ > 1)
	Work is done on the gas as it is compressed adiabatically and no heat flows, so internal energy (and T) increases
