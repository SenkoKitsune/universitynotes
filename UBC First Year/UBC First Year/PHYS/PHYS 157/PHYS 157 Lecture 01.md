Question 1:
What do you see


Question 2:
What is really happening here?
Use your knowledge of physics to describe

1) Hot plate
2) Aluminium
3) Room temperature block and hot block

Hotter temperature starts to move across the aluminium bridge
	Lighter colouration = hotter temperature

Various ways of heating
	conduction
	radiation (IR)

Heat: 
	lattice oscillation
	free electron movement
	quantum vibration

Thermodynamics 
Waves and oscillations

Goals of physics
1) Observe the universe
2) Understand the rules

Conservation of Energy:
An isolated system is a physical system that neither exchanges matter nor energy with its surroundings
	In isolated systems, the total energy is conserved
Energy exists in various forms: kinetic, thermal(random kinetic), potential (energy stored in interaction)

Energy may move back and forth between the various forms, but doesn't disappear or suddenly pop into place

In thermodynamics, we are concerned with the microscopic kinetic and potential energy of atoms and molecules
