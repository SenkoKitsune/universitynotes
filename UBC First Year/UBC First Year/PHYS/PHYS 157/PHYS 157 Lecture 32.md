If D<sub>1</sub>(x, t) is an allowed wave, and D<sub>2</sub>(x, t) is an allowed wave, then D<sub>1</sub>(x, t) + D<sub>2</sub>(x, t) is an allowed wave
When two or more waves overlap, the total displacement at that point is the sum of the displacements due to each individual wave
	Interference

Standing wave
Waves travelling in opposite directions on a taut string interfere
	Destructive interference occurs where the wave displacements cancel, and constructive interference occurs where the displacements add
	The results is a standing wave pattern that does not move on the string

Right moving wave:
A cos(kx - ωt) = A cos(kx) cos (ωt) + A sin(kx) sin(ωt)

Left moving wave:
A cos(kx - ωt) = A cos(kx) cos (ωt) - A sin(kx) sin(ωt)

Sum is a standing wave: 2A cos(kx) cos(ωt)
