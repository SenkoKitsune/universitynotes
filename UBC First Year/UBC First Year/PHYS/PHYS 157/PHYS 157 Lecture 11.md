Thermal Radiation
	Radiation from an object comes in a mix of wavelengths
	We can describe this by graphing the spectrum
	Area gives total power emitted in indicated range of wavelengths
	Power density
		W/m


Blackbody Spectrum
	Two properties
		peak as a function of temperature
		total radiated energy as a function of temperature


Peak wavelength is inversely proportional to T

Wien Displacement Law
	λ<sub>max</sub> = b/T
	b = 2.9 K mm
	eg) Sun: peak at ~500 nm (5700 K)
	Outer space: peak at ~ 1mm (2.7k) "cosmic microwave background"
	λ<sub>max</sub> ∝ 1/T

Wavelength(λ) is typically in nm

Black body is wide distribution

Total power from radiation 

Stefan-Boltzmann law ∝ T<sup>4</sup>
	H = A*e*σT<sup>4</sup>
A = surface area
*e* = emissivity (material constant)
σ = Stefan-Boltzmann constant = 5.67x10<sup>-8</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup> K<sup>4</sup>

*e* = 1 = perfect absorber (black)
*e* = 0 perfect reflector (mirror)

 *e* is the same for absorbing and radiating

Emissivity
Perfect absorber = "black body"
Emits the most thermal radiation for a given temperature
For other objects, define 
*e* = H / H<sub>blackbody</sub>
In general *e* depends on material properties but also on temperature and wavelength


Thermal equilibrium:
	Heat radiated = heat absorbed

Net heat current from thermal radiation in a uniform temperature environment

H = A*e*σ (T<sup>4</sup> - T<sub>s</sub><sup>4</sup>)

T<sub>s</sub><sup>4</sup> = temperature of surroundings

Steady-state:
	eg) to double temperature, we need 16 x power
