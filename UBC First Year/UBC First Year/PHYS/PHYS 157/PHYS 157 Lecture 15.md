Thermodynamic processes

U: internal energy of a gas
Sum of:
	kinetic energy
	rotational energy
	vibrational energy
	electrostatic potential energy

ΔU = n C<sub>b</sub> ΔT
	C<sub>b</sub> = molar specific heat
		larger for more complex molecules

U is the total kinetic energy of molecules
	U = N E<sup>avg</sup><sub>kin</sub>
	E<sup>avg</sup><sub>kin</sub> = (constant)(T)
	constant = (3 / 2)( R / N<sub>A</sub>)
		R = ideal gas constant
		N<sub>A</sub> = Avogadro's number
		U = 3/2 nRT

C<sub>v</sub> = 3/2 R


T is determined by P, C via PV = nRT
Same change in P, V = same change in T
ΔU is the same
	independent of the path

U is a "state variable": determined from PCTN
Idea gas: U is determined from T and n only
	ΔU only depends on initial and final state

Thermodynamic Processes
	Isochoric: Volume constant
	Isobaric: Pressure constant
	Isothermal: T constant
	Adiabatic: Q = 0

Isochoric
	Q = ΔU = nC<sub>v</sub>ΔT
	W = 0
	T<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>1</sub>

Q = ΔU - W
ΔU = nC<sub>v</sub>ΔT
W = PΔV = nRΔT (ideal gas law)
Q = n (C<sub>v</sub> + R)ΔT
Define C<sub>p</sub> = C<sub>v</sub> + R
Q = nC<sub>p</sub>ΔT


Isobaric
Ideal Gas Law T<sub>2</sub>/T<sub>1</sub> = V<sub>2</sub>/V<sub>1</sub>
W = nRΔT = pΔT

Isothermal:
PV = constant so P ∝ 1/V
ΔU = 0
Q = W = area under curve
W = $\int_{v_i}^{v_f} P(V)\, dV$ = nRT ln(v<sub>f</sub>/v<sub>i</sub>)
