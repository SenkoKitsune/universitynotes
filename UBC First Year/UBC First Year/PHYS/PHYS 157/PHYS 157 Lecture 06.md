Stress and strain

Stress:
	**Tensile stress** occurs when an object is stretched by forces acting at the ends, such as a guitar string
	**Compressive stress** is similar, just the opposite sign (*compression instead of extension*)
	Results in deformation

Force per area
Stress = F/A
	Stress has units of pressure

Fractional  change

Strain = ΔL/L<sub>0</sub>
Strain is dimensionless
The deformation is **elastic** if it goes back to initial size

Tensile stress and strain
	Related to an expansion
	The net force on the object is zero, but the object deforms
	The tensile stress produces a tensile strain
	Makes an object longer

Compression stress and strain
	An object in compression

A sufficient small tensile or compressive stress, stress and strain are linearly proportional
	Young's modulus
	Basic property of a material
		resistance to stretching or compressing
Y = stress/strain = (F/A)/(ΔL/L<sub>0</sub>)
	F/A = Y(ΔL/L<sub>0</sub>)
	Y is a property of the materials and doesn't depend on the size
Same force = same compression

Y has units of pressure
	It's a measure of how much pressure is required to produce a significant fractional change in length

Elasticity and plasticity
	Hooke's law - the proportionality of stress and strain in elastic deformations = has a limited range of validity
		Beyond a certain point, it becomes **plastic deformation**
			Will not go back to initial size/length
			Then becomes **fractured** once it reaches the fracture point

Discussion Question:
	A copper wire under a tension force of F and at temperature T initially has a length L. If we heat up the wire by ΔT and also change the tension force by ΔF, how would you determine how much length of the wire changes
		Treat the change in length from thermal expansion and the change in length from the force increase separately
		Total change in length is the sum of the change due to temperature and the change due to applied stress: ΔL = ΔL<sub>T</sub> + ΔL<sub>F</sub>
		Change in length = αLΔT
		Change in length due to applied stress
		Total expansion = αLΔT + ((F)(L<sub>0</sub>))/((A)(Y))
	A rod is heated by ΔT, it is then compressed down to its original length. Express F/A with Υ, α, ΔT, and L<sub>0</sub>
		F/A = αYΔT

Hard Question:
	A compound bar consisting of a copper rod with a length of 1m and a cross-sectional area of 2.00 cm<sup>2</sup> placed end to end with a steel rod with length 1 m and cross sectional area of 2.00 cm2 the compound rod is placed between 2 rigid walls. Initially there is no stress in the bars at room temperature
Find the force of each wall at 40<sup>o</sup>C

α and Υ are different, and they will likely change relative length
