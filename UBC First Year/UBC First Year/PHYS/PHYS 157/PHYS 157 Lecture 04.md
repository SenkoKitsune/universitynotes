How can we build a very accurate thermometer that is independent of material specifics

**Ideal Gas Thermometer** (Constant volume gas thermometer)
	Measures the pressure of an ideal gas of constant volume.
		Converts measured pressure to temperature
			Measuring temperature by measuring pressure

What is an ideal gas
An ideal gas is formed by point-like particles that do not interact with one another

*Real* gasses such as N, O, H, noble gasses are pretty good approximation to idea gasses, at low pressures and high temperatures
	low pressures = larger distance between atoms
	high temperatures = higher speed
		not affected by electromagnetic attraction of other particles as much
	

Pressure = force on wall per unit area

P= F/A
S.I. Unit of Pressure: Pascal = N/m<sup>2</sup>

Demo: 
	card on water in glass
	air pressure and surface tension keeps the water up
		mostly air pressure on the card keeps water in

Why gasses have pressure
	Air is made out of molecules
	Gas particles bounce against walls and impart momentum
		velocity & linear momentum changes
		ratio of momentum and time interval gives a force
		a large number of molecules contribute each a small amount of force on the wall

When we warm up the gas:
	Molecules move faster
		each collision imparts more momentum per collision
		collisions happen more frequently
		contributes to a stronger force

Celsius scale: p is Linear in T P = (m)T + b
Always extrapolates to P=0 at same T
	Always extrapolates to T<sub>kelvin</sub> = T<sub>Celsius</sub> + 273.15
		Same scale, but zero is at a different temperature
			Pressure is proportional to temperature with kelvin scale
	Different gases and number of molecules are at different pressures at different temperatures
	All the linear curves intersect at zero pressure and a certain temperature
T is proportional to P
T measured in Kelvin

The triple point is the point (T<sub>triple</sub>, p<sub>triple</sub>) is the ***phase diagram*** of a substance where the liquid, the solid and the gaseous phase can coexist
	For water, the temperature of the triple point is 
		T<sub>triple</sub> = 0.01 <sup>o</sup>C = 273.16 K
		P = 610 Pa
	Other than at this temperature and pressure, it only exists in one phase
