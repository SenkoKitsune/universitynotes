Waves
Periodic motion is any type of motion that repeats itself
	heartbeat
	atoms trapped in a magneto-optical trap
	ions trapped in a Penning trap
	atomic clocks
		frequency of valence e<sup>-</sup> of <sup>133</sup>Cs defines the second

We will concentrate on a particular subset of periodic motion, called simple harmonic motion

x(t) = A cos (ωt + Φ)
A = amplitude
ω = angular frequency
Φ= phase

Period T: time from max to min
T = 2π / ω since cos repeats every 2π

Frequency f: oscillations per unit time f = 1/ T

Gives: ω = $\sqrt{k/m}$ = 2π/Τ
k = spring constant
m = mass in kg

T<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> / T<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup> = w<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>/w<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup> = k/m<sub>1</sub> / k/m<sub>2</sub> = m<sub>2</sub>/m<sub>1</sub>

ω = 2πf = 2π / T
