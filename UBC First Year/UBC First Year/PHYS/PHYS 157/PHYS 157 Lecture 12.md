intensity is proportional to radiated power
	radiated power / area

Key relation for steady state heat flow: H<sub>in</sub> = H <sub>out</sub>


A 100W light bulb is placed at the centre of a perfectly sphere of absorbing material with radius R. A hole is cut, removing area A from the sphere. What is the rate of energy flow through the hole.
Light spreads out uniformly
	power leaving bulb = power reaching sphere
	Hole covers fraction A/4πR<sup>2</sup> of sphere
	SO power of light coming out is 100W x A/4πR<sup>2</sup>

Albedo
	Albedo is the overall average reflection coefficient for solar radiation incident on an object
	Albedo of the Earth is about 0.3 which means that the Earth as a whole reflects 30% of solar radiation
		a<sub>e</sub> = 0.3

Earth blocks the same amount of sunlight
What matters is the cross-sectional area πr<sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>
	Determines how much light actually hits the surface
		behind is blocked

Power hitting earth is H<sub>sun</sub>( (πr<sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>) / 4πR

The solar constant
At earth's orbit, the power per unit area, or Intensity, 
I<sub>sc</sub> = H<sub>s</sub> / 4πR<sup>2</sup><sub>s - e</sub> = 1367 W/m<sup>2</sup>

I<sub>sc</sub> is called the solar constant

Doubling the distance would mean 1/4 the intensity
In terms of I<sub>sc</sub> the heat current into the earth due to sunlight is
	H<sub>in</sub> ≈ πr<sub>e</sub><sup>2</sup>( 1 - a<sub>e</sub> ) I<sub>sc</sub>

I<sub>2</sub>/I<sub>1</sub> = (R<sub>1</sub>/R<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>


Calculate the equilibrium surface temperature T<sub>e</sub> in terms of a<sub>e</sub>, Is<sub>c</sub>, r<sub>e</sub>, R<sub>s-e</sub>, σ, and the emissivity e<sub>e</sub>

H<sub>in</sub> = absorbed sunlight
H<sub>out</sub> = IR Radiation
H<sub>rad</sub> = AeσT<sup>4</sup>
We have H<sub>in</sub> = H<sub>out</sub> (steady state)

πr2<sub>e</sub> (1-a<sub>e</sub>) <sub>Isc</sub> = 4πr<sub>e</sub>2 e<sub>e</sub> σ T<sup>4</sup><sub>e</sub>

T<sub>e</sub> = ( ((1 - a<sub>e</sub>) I<sub>sc</sub> ) / 4 e<sub>e</sub>σ)<sup>1/4</sup>

Greenhouse effect
	Some IR Radiation is absorbed by greenhouse gasses and reemitted back to earth
	Real e ≈ 0.6
Greenhouse gasses, especially CO<sub>2</sub>, absorbs IR radiation emitted by the earth and re-emit it back to earth, effectively reducing the earth's emissivity

In addition, as Earth warms, white, sunlight reflecting ice in the Arctic disappears, lowering albedo and furthering increasing the temperature

CO<sub>2</sub> closely correlates with temperature
	There is nothing guaranteed about our current temperature of 14.5
