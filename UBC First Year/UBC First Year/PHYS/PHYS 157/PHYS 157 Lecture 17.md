Heat Engines

PV<sup>γ</sup> = constant
nRT = PV

nRT/V = P

(nRT / V)( V<sup>γ</sup> ) = constant
TV<sup>γ-1</sup> = constant

Stirling cycle:
	partially converts heat to work via cyclic process
	1) isothermal expansion
	2) isochoric cooling
	3) isothermal compression
	4) isochoric heating
expansion and compression are done at constant T

Efficiency of heat engines

Q<sub>H</sub> = heat absorbed by gas each cycle
Q<sub>c</sub> = Heat expelled y gas each cycle
W = net work done each cycle

Efficiency = e = W / Q<sub>H</sub> = work we get out  heat we need to supply
	= 1 - |Q<sub>c</sub>| / |Q<sub>H</sub>|
