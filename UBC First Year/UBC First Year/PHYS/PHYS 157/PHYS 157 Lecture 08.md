T = (m<sub>1</sub>c<sub>1</sub> / (m<sub>1</sub>c<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>c<sub>2</sub>)T<sub>1</sub> + ((m<sub>2</sub>c<sub>2</sub>) / m<sub>1</sub>c<sub>1</sub> + m<sub>2</sub>c<sub>2</sub>)T<sub>2</sub>

Weighted average of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>

Phases of matter
	Take some molecules
	Put them in a container at some temperature & pressure
	Significant changes in configuration of molecules can occur as we vary temperature and pressure

Phase diagram:
	displays phases and phase transition curves as a function of T and P
	sharp discontinuous lines to separate phases of a material


Phase change:
	Macroscopic properties change dramatically across phase boundaries
	At transition temperature, transition occurs due to heat added/removed with **no temperature change**
	Amount of heat required for transition per mass of material is called the **latent heat**
		L<sub>f</sub> = latent heat of fusion (freezing/melting)
		L<sub>v</sub> = latent heat of vaporization (boiling/condensing)
Latent heat
	heat required to melt/boil a mass m of material (at melting/boiling T) is:
		Q = m L
		use L<sub>f</sub> for melting/freezing
		use L<sub>v</sub> for boiling/condensing
		units of L are J/kg
		L is the energy required to melt/freeze 1 kg of material

Poor mixing as ice melts, non-uniform temperature causes the graph to be curved
	temperature of the water can be raised while there is still ice in the mixture

Q = mc<sub>solid</sub> ΔT -> T constant, Q = m L<sub>f</sub>  -> mc<sub>liquid</sub> ΔT -> T constant, Q = m L<sub>v</sub>  ->  mc<sub>gas</sub> ΔT

Slopes and lengths are different due to difference in specific heats and latent heats

Thermal conductivity
	Heat moves more quickly through some materials than others in response to a temperature gradient
	Determines heat current from temperature gradient
	H = k A (T<sub>H</sub> - T<suv>c</sub>)/L
	A - cross sectional area
	H - heat current J/s
	K = thermal conductivity, a basic property of a material
