Thermometer & Temperature scale

The zeroth law ensures consistent temperature readings

How to measure temperature
We can assign a numerical value for different temperatures by using some temperature dependent macroscopic property of a standard object( volume of a liquid)
--Use thermal expansion of a liquid
Reference temperatures:
1) Freezing point of water -> 0 <sup>o</sup>C -> 212 <sup>o</sup>F
2) Boiling point of water -> 100 <sup>o</sup>C -> 32 <sup>o</sup>F
	1) Linear scale in between

T<sub>F</sub> = $\frac{9}{5}$ T<sub>C</sub> + 32

The linear interpolation of temperature between the two reference temperatures, based on thermal expansion of some substance, is purely phenomenological
	It is not an exact law of nature
As a result, temperature measurement by the above method becomes slightly material dependant
	Not good for experiments/accurate readings

eg) Assumed relation at 50<sup>o</sup>C is above correct relation at 50<sup>o</sup>C
	For a mercury thermometer with equally spaced temperature markings, if the thermometer reads 50 <sup>0</sup>C, actual temperature is a bit higher than 50<sup>o</sup>C
	We have to look at where the temperature where the actual curve reaches 50 <sup>0</sup>C to find actual temperature of the thermometer

The actual curve depends on material properties

Where does the idea of change Volume proportional to change Temp
	Every differentiable function is near-linear in sufficiently small intervals
