1st Law of Thermodynamics
	ΔE = Q - W
	ΔE is also called ΔU
	Energy conservation

Gas stores energy through movement
Idea gas pressure
	P = (constant)( n/V )( m )(V<sup>2</sup><sub>avg</sub> )
	where
		n/V - density
		m v<sup>2</sup><sub>avg</sub> = 2x kinetic energy per molecule
		
Molecule hitting the wall imparts momentum
	conservation of momentum

Double:
	density -> double P
	mass -> double P
	velocity -> quadruple P (2x collisions (time between collisions lessens by 1/2), 2x impact (more imparted momentum) )

For constant n and V: P ∝ E<sup>avg</sup><sub>kin</sub>
 P ∝ T
T = (constant x)( E<sup>avg</sup><sub>kin</sub> )

Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of the molecules

P = ((constant) n / V ) T
PV = nRT
	n = number of moles
	R = Gas constant = 8.31 J/ ( mole K )

Cup, water, flame experiment
	Flame extinguishes -> temperature drops -> pressure inside decreases -> water is pushed into the cup because outside pressure is higher


W = F Δx<sub>||</sub>  (constant force)

F = force exerted
Δx<sub>||</sub>  = displacement in direction of force
