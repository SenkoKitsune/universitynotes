Around a full thermodynamic cycle, the net heat flow is equal to the net work.
	ΔU = 0

Otto cycle
	expansion and compression are dong adiabatically 
	"gasoline engine"


V<sub>max</sub> = rV<sub>min</sub>
1) Compression stroke A - B
	1) adiabatic compression
		1) air and fuel mixture enters the cylinder and gets compressed
		2) Very fast, no time for heat to leave the cylinder

2) combustion of the gasoline B - C
	1) ≈ heating at a constant volume
		1) combustion of the mixture
		2) idea gas law

3) Power stroke C - D
	1) adiabatic expansion

4) exhaust and intake D - A
	1) not a significant amount of net work so model as constant volume process
		1) Isochoric cooling
	2) exhaust out (exhaust stroke)
	3) air and gasoline in (intake stroke)
	4) There is an isobaric process forwards and backwards
		1) cancels out

W<sub>net</sub> = nC<sub>v</sub> (T<sub>C</sub> - T<sub>D</sub> + T<sub>A</sub> - T<sub>B</sub>)


e =  (nC<sub>v</sub> (T<sub>C</sub> - T<sub>D</sub> + T<sub>A</sub> - T<sub>B</sub>)  )/ ( T<sub>C</sub> - T<sub>B</sub> )
e = 1 - 1/ (r<sup>γ - 1</sup>)

Compression = ratio of large volume / small volume = r

e =  (nC<sub>v</sub> (T<sub>C</sub> - T<sub>D</sub> + T<sub>A</sub> - T<sub>B</sub>)  )/ ( T<sub>C</sub> - T<sub>B</sub> ) = (T<sub>C</sub> - T<sub>B</sub>) - (T<sub>D</sub> - T<sub>A</sub>) / (T<sub>C</sub> - T<sub>B</sub>) = 1 - (T<sub>D</sub> - T<sub>A</sub>) / (T<sub>C</sub> - T<sub>B</sub>)

Now use T<sub>D</sub> V<sub>max</sub><sup>γ-1</sup> = T<sub>C</sub> V<sub>min</sub><sup>γ-1</sup> and T<sub>A</sub> V<sub>max</sub><sup>γ-1</sup> = T<sub>B</sub> V<sub>min</sub><sup>γ-1</sup> to write (T<sub>D</sub> = T<sub>A</sub> )V<sub>max</sub>)<sup>γ-1</sup> = T<sub>C</sub> - T<sub>B</sub>)V<sub>min</sub><sup>γ-1</sup>
	e = 1 - 1/r <sup>γ-1</sup>


Higher efficiency for larger compression ration r = V<sub>max</sub> / V<sub>min</sub>

But:
	Gasoline will spontaneously ignite if r is too large
		engine knocking
	High octane fuel: higher ignition temp, so less knocking
	In real engines
		r ~ 9-10 and γ ~ 1.22 and e ~ 38%


Diesel engines
	Starting at point a, air is compressed adiabatically to point b, heated at constant pressure to point c, expanded adiabatically to point d, and cooled at a constant volume to point a
	Because there is no fuel in the cylinder during the compression stroke, pre-ignition cannot occur, and thte compression ration r can be much higher than for a gasoline engine
	improves efficiency
	r ~ 15 - 23
	γ ~ 1.22
	e ~ 45% - 50%

1) Compression stroke
	1) Adiabatic compression
2) Fuel ignition
	1) Heating at constant pressure
	2) Significant difference between Diesel and Otto cycles
3) Power stroke
	1) Adiabatic expansion
4) Cooling of exhaust gases
	1) Isochoric cooling
