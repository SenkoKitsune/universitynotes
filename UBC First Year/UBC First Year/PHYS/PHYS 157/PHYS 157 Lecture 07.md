Y is the ratio of stress over strain
Linear relationship is only valid in certain regions
	small stress or strain
	elastic regime
		plastic regime: no longer reversible

Heat
	Q = heat (Joules): amount of energy transferred due to temperature differences
	Heat will flow from hot to cold
	form of energy

Heat flows from the hotter object to the cooler 
temperature of hot object decreases and the cold object increases

Heat required to raise the temperature of a material of mass M is determined by its specific heat, c:
	Q = mcΔT
	Q = heat added
	m = mass
	c = specific heat
	ΔT = change in temperature
	Units of c are J/(kg K) : ci is a measure of the energy required to heat 1 kg of material by 1 K


Smaller ΔT for same Q, so smaller slope (rise/run)

Molar heat capacity:
	Heat required to raise temperature of a material of n moles is determined by its molar heat capacity, C
		Q = nCΔT
		n = # of moles
		C = molar heat capacity (molar specific heat)
	C in J/(mol K): energy required to heat 1 mole of material by 1 K

Why do heat capacities differ
	Temperature proportional to average kinetic energy of molecules
	For more complicated materials, part of energy added goes to rotations/vibrations, etc..., so it takes more Q to increase the internal energy
	Large molecules have more ways of storing energy compared to smaller ones
		more atoms to rotate, vibrate, etc...

Energy conservation:
	Q<sub>1</sub> + Q<sub>2</sub> = 0
