Transmission of heat

Thermal resistance measures the effectiveness of insulation layer
R = L/k
L = thickness
k = thermal conductivity

"R-value" is this quantity in units of ft<sup>2</sup> F<sup>o</sup> hours/BTU or m<sup>2</sup> K s/J

Larger s better

BTU is the "British thermal unit", 1 BTU = 1055 J

H/A = Th - TC / R
H/A = heat current per unit area
R = thermal resistance (L/k)

I = V2 - V1 /R
I = electrical current
R = electrical resistance

Multiple layers add R values (like resistors in series)
A deals with adding insulation layers in parallel

Two materials of equal dimensions but different thermal conductivities are placed side to side between objects kept at 0<sup>o</sup>C and 100<sup>o</sup>C, and a temperature in the middle is less than 50<sup>o</sup>C
*Think of extreme cases: if k<sub>2</sub> is an almost perfect insulator, T will be almost 0<sup>o</sup>C in steady state situation*

Calculate the temperature:
	Calculate T in terms of k<sub>1</sub> and k<sub>2</sub>
	k<sub>1</sub> > k<sub>2</sub>
	H<sub>1</sub> (k<sub>1</sub>)
	H<sub>2</sub> (k<sub>2</sub>)
	How do H1 and H2 vary in time and how are they related to each other
		Energy conservation and steady flow -> H<sub>1</sub> = H<sub>2</sub> and constant in time
	H1 = k<sub>1</sub> A (T-T<sub>C</sub>)/L = H<sub>2</sub> = k<sub>2</sub> A (T<sub>H</sub> - T)/L
	k<sub>1</sub> A (T-T<sub>C</sub>)/L  = k<sub>2</sub> A (T<sub>H</sub> - T)/L

Other mechanisms for heat transfer

Convection
	Free
		Fluids have different densities at different temperatures
		hot fluids rise / cold fluids sink
		Fluid circulates and carries heat with it
		Likewise with air
	Forced convection
		eg) heating a house
		cooling a car engine and heating the interior
		used forced to move the hot liquid/air around

Electromagnetic radiation
	Light is an electromagnetic wave
		Oscillating electric field <-> Oscillating magnetic field
			Electric generates magnetic
			Magnetic generated electric

Properties of light
	Colour: determined by wavelength
	Intensity and brightness: determined by amplitude
		Light carries energy

Thermal radiation from an object
	Typically in IR/visible
	Spectrum: measures energy current for various wavelengths

At Î»<sub>max</sub>, there is the most amount of energy
