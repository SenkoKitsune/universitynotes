Thermal

H = k A (T<sub>H</sub> - T<sub>C</sub>)/L
H = heat current (Joules/second)
K = thermal conductivity, a basic property of a material
A = cross sectional area
(T<sub>H</sub> - T<sub>C</sub>)/L = temperature gradient (dT/dx)

Temperature will change more quickly at first, and mores slowly as they approach equilibrium

What determines the initial slope of the temperature vs time?

A heat current H flows into the cooler block. In a time dt, what is the change dT in the temperature of this block (in terms of dt and the quantities shown?)

How much heat enters the block during this time?
	H<sub>1</sub> is heat per unit time, and dt is time, so in time dt, heat added is Q = H<sub>1</sub> dt
How fast does the temperature change?
	We have dT<Sub>1</sub> = Q/ ( Mc ) so dT<sub>1</sub> = H/(Mc) dt and dT/dt = H<sub>1</sub> /Mc

dT<sub>1</sub> /dt = (k A / (M c L) )(T<sub>2</sub> - T<sub>1</sub>)

dT<sub>2</sub> /dt = -((k A) / M c L)(T<sub>2 </sub> - T<sub>1</sub>)


Δ = T<sub>2</sub> - T<sub>1</sub>

d(T2 - T1)/dt = dΔ/dt

Δ(t) = Δ<sub>t=0</sub> * e<sup>-(kA/m c L)(t)</sup> = Δ<sub>t=0</sub> * e<sup>=t/τ</sup>

τ = McL/kA is called the time constant
At small times, Δ(t) approx. = -Δ<sub>t=0</sub> (t/τ) linear in t
T<sub>2</sub>(t) - T<sub>1</sub>(t) = Δ<sub>t=0</sub> e<sup>-t/τ</sup>

d(T<sub>1</sub>(t) + T<sub>2</sub>(t))/dt = 0
