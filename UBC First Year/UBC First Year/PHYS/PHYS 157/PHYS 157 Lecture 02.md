Thermal energy comes from vibrations in molecules
	Both kinetic and potential

Conservation of Energy
An **isolated system** is a physical system that doesn't exchange matter or energy with its surroundings
	Total energy is conserved, the same at any moment in time

Kinetic, thermal (random kinetic), potential (energy stored in interaction)
	thermal: not a directed motion, like an object moving


Lead ball experiment
	kinetic and potential energy converted to thermal and sound
	heat lost to surroundings through radiation
	inelastic deformation -> energy into friction and heat

**Temperature**
	The hotter an object, the more kinetic and potential energy is stored in its atoms and molecules
	A change in the temperature brings about the change of other properties of an object (often slight changes), such as
		size and volume, radiation emitted, electric conductivity, etc
When we heat and cool, we add/remove energy
	When we heat/cool and object, its volume typically increases/decreases
	Hot objects radiate more than cold objects

Equilibrium and measuring temperature
A thermometer measures its *own* temperature
Two systems in thermal contact approach equilibrium
In thermal equilibrium their temperatures agree

Equilibrium has properties

The zeroth law of thermodynamics
If system *A* is in thermal equilibrium with system B, and system B is in thermal equilibrium with system C, then system A is in thermal equilibrium with system C

eg) B and C are the right and left halves of a brick

First measurement A reaches equilibrium with B
		by the zeroth law, the thermometer is also in equilibrium with C
		and measurement: temp at C is the same temperature
