Stirling engine: heat supplied by external reservoir
Different from refrigerator:
	expansion at high T instead of compression at high T
	Heat absorbed at high  instead of emitted
Like an Otto cycle engine, but isothermal compression/expansion instead of adiabatic
Gives net work out

1) Isothermal expansion
2) Isochoric cooling
3) Isothermal expansion
4) Isochoric heating 


Alpha type engine
	Two cylinders
	expansion cylinder is maintained at high T
	compression cylinder is cooled
	Passage between them contains the regenerator

Beta-type Stirling engine
	One cylinder
	hot at one end, cold at the other
	Loose-fitting displacer shunts the air between the cold and hot ends
	Power piston at open end of cylinder drives a flywheel
