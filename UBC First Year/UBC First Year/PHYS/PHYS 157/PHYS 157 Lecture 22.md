entropy is additive

S<sub>Total</sub> = S<sub>1</sub> + S<sub>2</sub>

entropy S ∝ ln(number of microstates)

S<sub>AB</sub> = k ln(N x M) = k [ln(N) + ln(M)] = S<sub>A</sub> + S<sub>B</sub> 

The logarithm is compatible with S being additive

Change in entropy for a cyclic process is 0

Entropy is a property of state

ΔS is the same for all paths and zero for a complete cycle

But: S for environment usually increases
