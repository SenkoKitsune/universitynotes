Role of Decision Making, Scales, and Stakeholders in Engineering Projects

Decision Making:
	Stockholm is a city built on several islands with dozens of bridges connecting them, but has terrible traffic congestion. **City planers immediately recommended the obvious solution of building another bridge**
		results in more cars on the roads
		temporary fix

Decision making process

Define the decision
Study and clarify the decision context
generate decision options (alternatives)
identify the best decision option
refine and develop the best
revise if necessary
recommend the decision


Use a decision-making process or framework to guide solution-finding
Thinking at different scales can lead to a good solution


Spatial scale levels
Project site -> local -> regional -> national -< global

Governmental
Municipal -> Regional -> Provincial -> Federal -> International

Temporal
Distant past -> Near Past -> Current -> Near future -> Distant future

Social
Personal -> Friends and family -> Community


What is the most important reason to engage stakeholders in a proposed project
	To enable stakeholders to voice their concerns and to ensure that they can examine, and perhaps participate in, the decision-making process
