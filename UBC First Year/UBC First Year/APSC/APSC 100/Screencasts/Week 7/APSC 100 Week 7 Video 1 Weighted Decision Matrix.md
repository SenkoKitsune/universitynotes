Use to make decisions involving trade-offs

Scores are based on stakeholder satisfaction
	10/10 = cannot further improve satisfaction
	0/10 = minimally acceptable performance

Weighted Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | Option 1 | Option 2 | ... | Option N |
| -------- | ------ | -------- | -------- | --- | -------- |
|          |        |          |          |     |          |
| 

Distribution of weights should reflect the priorities of the stakeholders
	Sum of the weights **must** add up to 100%


Decision not sensitive to weights is robust
