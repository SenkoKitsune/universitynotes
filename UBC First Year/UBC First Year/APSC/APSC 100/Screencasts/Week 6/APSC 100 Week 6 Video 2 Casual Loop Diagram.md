Describe and understand complex systems

Deterministic systems:
	good understanding
	accurately determine how the systems will behave

Quantitative vs Qualitative


Elements in the diagram are called Nodes
relationships are showed with a directional link
	Positive relationship (+)
		both nodes change the same way

Delay is shown with a double line on the connecting link

Reinforcing loop
	Start on any node, increase the parameter for that node, then work around the entire loop, the parameter that we started with will increase
Negative relationship (-)
	nodes change in opposite ways

Balancing loop:
	Start on any node, increase the parameter for that node, then work around the entire loop, the parameter that we started with will decrease
