Stage 2: Generate Potential Solutions

Goal: generate as many potential solutions to our design problem as possible

Problem:
	immediately identify one possible solution
	time and variety graph
		come up with more ideas
			variety of ideas increase when time increases
			solution space:
				solution will come from one or more in the solution space
			don't know which solution is the best

Can't rely on first impressions
	Good may become bad if more information
		vice-versa

Not just number, but variety of ideas

Mistakes:
	ending too early

When to stop
	depends on how good the idea is
	good chance of solving
	how much time
	how routine
	how quickly new ideas are generated
Fixation:
	not coming up with enough novel ideas
	getting stuck on one idea

Desired result:
	large number and variety of ideas

Guidelines
	generate as many unique ideas as possible
		Focus on quantity not quality
		Welcome creative, unusual, and "wild" ideas
	Resist the temptation to start developing your first idea or favourite idea
		avoid fixation (anchoring)
	Do not evaluate ideas yet - that will come later
		Focus on what will make ideas work
	Generate a variety of ideas
		Work independently and in a team
		Sketch, discuss, tinker

C-sketch
	Collaborative Sketching
1) Team clarifies the the problem 
2) each time sketches a solution
	1) no writing or words
	2) quite, focused time
	3) not about creating works of art
4) passes sketches to the person
5) review and modify
	1) add or remove
6) Continues until everyone contributes to every sketch
7) Collect, review, and discuss
	1) Combine
	2) Form new solutions based on previous
