Goal: narrow down all *possible* solutions to our design problem, and identify *the* solution to be developed

Any idea could be the winner
	we don't know which is weak or strong
	be objective and systematic

Requirements: the limits of acceptability for a design

Screening
	Identify solutions that do not meet requirements
		Try to make the solution work by modifying it before discarding it

Evaluation criteria: measures that distinguish between levels of performance or stakeholder satisfaction

Ranking:
	Sort solutions by approximate highest to lowest performance
	rough estimate

Ideas to carry forward: scoring
	analyse these ideas in greater detail
	too many ideas through ranking = extra work
	too few ideas = might overlook top idea
	identify one solution to carry on


Screening:
	Compare to requirements
	Eliminate ideas that cannot meet requirements
	
Ranking
	Roughly rank from strong to weak using evaluation criteria
	Look for consistently strong ideas

Scoring
	Quantify relative performance

Ranking methods: individual voting
	Everyone needs to have a good understanding of the problem, the concepts, and the evaluation criteria

Everyone has a set number of votes
	Have each person vote independently to encourage diversity and avoid "groupthink"
	Multiple votes for any concept
	Totals the vote and see what to keep and what to drop
	Voting on incomplete information and subjective voting

Criterion-Based Ranking
	Ranked based on criterion
		above-average ratings get a mark

Iteration:
	selected solution may become not a good solution
