Engineering at different scales

Different engineers design different parts

Collection of assemblies, subassemblies, and others

different systems interacting with each other

Eg: potholes
	better materials for cars
	better wheel design
	systems to maximize comfort and minimize damage to car
	better road design
	regional policy on maintenance
	investing in alternate forms of transportation

depends on context
works on different scales

Increasing scales
	fix the car
	fix the road
	fix the road network
	fix the transportation system

different stakeholder groups, concern and solutions emerge by looking across scales
