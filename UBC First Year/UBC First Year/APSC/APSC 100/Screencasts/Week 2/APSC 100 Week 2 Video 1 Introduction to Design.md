What is design?
	creativity, innovation, problem solving, invention, prototype
	**process**
Engineering *design* is the *process* through which engineering knowledge and skills are applied to solve real-world, open-ended problems.
	open-ended: no one singular solution

Textbook problems are well defined and have a single right answer

Novice Approach to design

Problem -> implement solution -> refine solution -> reimplement solution
	Trial and error
		not a good approach for engineering teams
		Likely not an optimal solution
			takes more time, money and resources
			dead ends
Systematic process = success + on time + on budget

Stage 0: Problem
Stage 1: Study and clarify the problem: most are not well defined, vague idea of problem, not detailed knowledge of problem context
Stage 2: Generate potential solutions: identify as many solutions as possible; resist implementing first idea that comes to mind
Stage 3: Identify the most promising solution: narrowing down all solutions until you identify the one you will pursue
Stage 4: Develop and test solution: analyse, refine, and develop the chosen solution using engineering tools, science, and math
Stage 4.5: Iteration: review and revise solution; continuously revisit previous stages as the solution develops and you learn more
	continuously review and revising previous work
Stage 5: implement solution: construct or detail the final solution, consideration of maintenance, operation, and recycling and others

Simplified: general flow
As you work on one part, it could result going back to another stage
	eg) new information on problem; new potential solution; 

Support for the Design Process
	Costs: money, time, resources
	don't spend a lot in early stages compared to later stages
	Costs committed: future costs that are determined based on decision made during design process
		early decision determine most of the spending that occurs later in the process

Early decisions are inexpensive, but determine how much time, money, or resources we will spend later
	Essential early stages are right
