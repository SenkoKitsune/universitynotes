Prototype:
	simple models or representations of a final design

Eg: Ojex Juicer prototypes
	early designs start as sketches
		count as prototypes
		disposable
		cheap to produce
	foam
	functioning models
find the simplest, quickest, least expensive way to answer questions and learn about the problem

Prototype classification


                                             Physical



Focused -------------------------------------------------Comprehensive
(one or two aspects)                                                        (near complete representations)



                                           Virtual

Use of prototypes
	identify design errors
	learn about the problem
	Early                              ->                   Late
	Quick, inexpensive, simple prototypes ->detailed, accurate prototypes
Early:
	explore
	suggest
	question
	provoke
Late:
	refine
	describe
	answer
	resolve

Primary purpose of prototypes:
	reduce risk in the design process
